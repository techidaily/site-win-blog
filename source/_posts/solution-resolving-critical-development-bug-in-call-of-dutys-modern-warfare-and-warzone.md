### Fix 1: Make sure your specs meet the requirements

 As a AAA title in 2019, Modern Warfare is challenging, both to your game skills and computer hardware. So if you’re sticking with a PC built five years ago, chances are you won’t find this “slow-motion” game enjoyable. If you notice your FPS is dropping constantly, and even worse during a shoot-out, the first thing you should do is to**check your specs and see if they meet the game requirements** . Because if they don’t, then maybe it’s time for an upgrade.

#### Minimum requirements of Modern Warfare (30 FPS)

| **Operating System:** | Windows 7 64-bit (SP1)                                               |

| **CPU:**              | Intel Core i3-4340 or AMD FX-6300                                    |
| **RAM:**              | 8 GB                                                                 |

#### Recommended requirements of Modern Warfare (60 FPS)

| **Operating System:** | Windows 10 64-bit                                                                     |

| **CPU:**              | Intel Core i5-2500K or AMD Ryzen R5 1600X                                             |
| **RAM:**              | 12 GB                                                                                 |

### Fix 2: Change Display Mode

 Some Modern Warfare gamers reported that changing the Display Mode from**Fullscreen Borderless** to**Fullscreen** fixes their FPS dropping issue. You can give this a try as it may boost your FPS right away.

You can do it with only 2 steps:

1. Open Modern Warfare and go to**Options** .
2. Navigate to the**Graphics** tab. Under the**Display** section and to the right of**Display Mode** , click the box and select**Fullscreen** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/modern-warfare-set-to-fullscreen.jpg)
3. Join a game and see if your FPS gets better.

 If changing Display Mode doesn’t give you any luck, you can check out the next solution.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 When you’re experiencing FPS drops during gameplay, nine times out of ten you’re using a**faulty or outdated graphics driver** . That’s also why we recommend gamers to always keep their graphics driver up to date. Driver updates come with not only bug fixes but improvements of compatibility with new titles.

 You can update your GPU driver manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then search, download and install the graphics driver step by step. But if you don’t like playing with device drivers, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do these automatically. It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/de-rtx-2060-clean.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your computer and join a game in Modern Warfare. You can now test the gameplay and see if the driver update helps your case.

 If updating the driver doesn’t do the trick for you, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Check for Windows updates

 If the last time you check for windows updates feel like ages ago, you need to do it right now. Every once in a while, aside from regular security patches, Windows updates install some edgy features on your computer, which might be a potential fix to your Modern Warfare FPS issue.

And it’s quite easy to update too:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the**Settings** app. Then click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-setting-app-security-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then check and install updates automatically. This might take a while depending on your Internet speed.

3. Once you’ve installed the updates, restart the computer.

 To install all the available updates, you might need to repeat these steps several times until Windows prompts that you’re up to date when you click**Check for updates** .

 After updating your system, launch Modern Warfare and check if your FPS has been improved.

 If this method doesn’t help your case, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 5:**Clean up resource-hungry processes**

 Sometimes your game becomes laggy when you have some background tasks eating up your RAM or CPU resources. Before opening a game in Modern Warfare, first make sure you’ve exited programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** ,**Skype** or**Windows Update** that might exhaust your computer resources.

 If you’re sure you’ve left enough resources for Modern Warfare and the FPS issue is still there, check out the next fix to change your power plan.

### Fix 6: Change your power plan to Ultimate Performance

 Microsoft has added a new power plan called “**Ultimate Performance** ” to Windows 10 April 2018 Update. This plan aims to fully exploit the potential of your computer, so it might be a solution to your FPS dropping issue.

Here’s how to enable this power plan:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command box. Type**powercfg.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cmd-run-power-option.jpg)
2. Select**Ultimate Performance** . If you don’t see this power plan, please continue to the next step to unhide it.
