### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 Restarting your PC might be the easiest working fix to try. And it works most of the time. Follow the steps to restart your PC when the taskbar is not working or disappears.

2. In your right bottom of the screen, click the**power button** and choose Restart.

If this simple reboot doesn’t work, the next fix might help.

### Fix 4: Repair system files

 Windows taskbar issues could be related to the Windows system files. When Windows system files are missing or outdated, it may trigger bugs like the taskbar not working or disappearing from the desktop.

 Therefore, you need a tool to check the system files and repair the corrupted files automatically. If you’re familiar with command codes, you can run**System File Checker** to check the system files. But it takes time and you have to enter the correct command.

 Or, you can turn to a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your PC and fix them automatically. We recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , as it’s tailored to the Windows system and works in a private way.

### Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 When your graphics driver is outdated or corrupted, it may hinder user interface suche as taskbar to work properly. There are two ways to check if your graphics driver is up-to-date and functioning properly.

**Checking manuall** – If you’re a savvy user and don’t mind spend sometime on it, you can go to the manufacturer’s official webpage ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), downlaod the correct driver and install it manually.

**Checking automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
