### 1\. Check the server status

 Error code 327, error code 721 are quite the same. They often appear when attempting to join the game. The first thing to do is restarting the game and try to connect to the server again. When it’s not working, check Star Wars Battlefront 2 server status, if it’s a server problem, you need to wait for the developer team to do the work, there is not much you can do.

You can also play at another time when the servers are a little lighter.

### 2\. Use a VPN

 If it’s not a server problem, a VPN may help you fix the issue. Using a VPN would change the server you linked and make a difference. A paid VPN provides you a safe and better internet performance.

[**Express VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) are big brands with good reputations.

 Here we take **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as an example:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN on your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.

4. Relaunch Star War Battlefront 2.

 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.

### 3\. Update your driver

 The error code is related to the network connectivity which network driver involves.
