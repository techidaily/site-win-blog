 You need to reconnect your DS4 controller device. If nothing changes — DS4 Windows driver not installing or DS4 Windows not detecting controller, you should move on to the next fix.

**Note:** The DS4 Windows from<http://ds4windows.com/> has not been updated for a long time. It is the one on **[DS4 Windows New Releases](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases)**  that keeps updating from time to time.

### Fix 3: Re-enable your controller

 DS4 Windows will fail to detect your PS4 if your controller is disabled. To check if this is the culprit, you can go to Device Manager.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.

 2) Expand**Human Interface Devices** and right-click**HID-compliant game controller** , then select**Enable** **device** . (For Bluetooth users, it’s**Bluetooth-HID-device** . )

If it’s already enabled, you can disable and enable it again.

3) Disconnect your controller and restart your PC.

4) Close Steam.

5) Open your DS4 Windows. Go to the**Settings** tab to check the**Hide DS4 controller** .

 If the**Hide DS4 controller** option is already checked, then uncheck and check it again.

 6) Try connecting your controller again. Your device should be displayed in the**Controller** tab now.

 If re-enabling the controller fails, you can go back to the Device Manager to uninstall the**HID-compliant game controller** . Then close your DS4 Windows and disconnect your controller and connect it again. Afterward, open DS4 Windows, and you will see your controller here again.

### Fix 4: Uninstall the game controller driver

 Still can’t fix your DS4 Windows not detecting your controller problem? It might be other device drivers that are causing your DS4 Windows not to work. You can follow these steps to test the issue:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** +**R** key at the same time, and type in**control** . Then press**Enter** .

### Fix 5: Uninstall the latest Windows Update
