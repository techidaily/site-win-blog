## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 Granzella Inc., the creator of R-Type Final 2, releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 By overclocking the CPU or turbo-boosting the graphics card, players would gain a better FPS. However, it increase the chance of game crashing issues.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Add the game as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 3rd party antivirus software may block the game files, which would lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch R-Type Final 2 and see if it crashes after you added it as an exception to your antivirus software.

 If none of the fixes above works, try reinstalling the game. Normally, after reinstalling the game, you’ll be able to fix the crashing issue.
