 You might not need to try them all. Simply work down the list until you find the one that scores.

1. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Switch your DirectX version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Lower in-game graphical settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 Broken or missing game files could lead to constant crashes. So before you try anything else, first make sure there’s nothing wrong with the game files.

Here’s how to do that on Origin:

1. Open your Origin client. In the left pane, click**My Game Library** .

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, game crashes are graphics related. In other words, the constant crashes could indicate you’re using a**buggy or outdated graphics driver** . New drivers usually tackle compatibility issues, so always make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver.

 Of course you can update your drivers manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), then search, download and install the driver step by step. But if you don’t like fiddling with device drivers, you can leave it to[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
