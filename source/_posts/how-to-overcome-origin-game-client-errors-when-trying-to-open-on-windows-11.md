1. [**Update your graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. **[Run System File Checker](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. [**Clear your browsing data**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

7. [**Uninstall and reinstall Chrome**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Update your graphics card driver

 If your graphics card driver is corrupted after Windows 10 updates, it may stop Chrome from working properly. To better troubleshoot the problem, you should update your graphics card driver.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics card driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics card driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** . You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

1. Type **chrome://extensions** in the address bar and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebc3f96a48a.png)

1. At the top right in Chrome, click the**three dots** \>**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebd83fd4eb4.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebcffb97b0e.jpg)
