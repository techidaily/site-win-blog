## Quick Fixes for Gaming Glitch: Stop Grand Theft Auto 5 From Freezing Now

It’s frustrating when you experience performance or stability problems during gameplay. Recently, many**_Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5)_** players have reported the game freezing issue.

 Although it’s hard to detect the cause of this issue because of the number of unique hardware and software settings players have, there are a few solutions you can try to rule out common problems.

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[End unnecessary programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify your game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Adjust your virtual memory](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall your game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-58-08.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**4)**  Relaunch_GTA5_ to test your issue.

If your issue continues to occur, then move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: End unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time while gaming, that could cause your PC to overload and make your game freeze.

 To see if that’s the cause of the_GTA5_ freezing problem, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-03-45-1024x251.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select**End Task** . Specifically, if you have the Riva Statistics software or MSI Afterburner, try turning them off when you’re gaming to see if the issue persists.

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-07-59.jpg)

**3)** Restart_GTA5_ to see if this fixed your issue.

If it didn’t, read on and try Fix 3.

## Fix 3: Verify your game files

 This issue might happen when one or more_GTA5_ files on your PC are corrupt or missing. If you’re playing the game on Steam, follow the instructions below to verify your game files:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** . Then, right-click**Grand Theft Auto V** and select**Properties** .

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)

**3)** Click the **LOCAL FILES** tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

 This could take several minutes. Wait for the process to be complete.

**4)** Relaunch_GTA5_ to test your issue.

 If your game still won’t run correctly, then go ahead with the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Adjust your virtual memory

**Virtual memory** is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when running _GTAV_ , Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If you don’t have enough virtual memory to save temporary files, that can cause your game to freeze.

 If that’s the problem for you, increasing your virtual memory can fix it. Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then click **View advanced system settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-41.jpg)

**2)** Click **Settings** .

**3)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-31.jpg)

**4)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**5)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-22.jpg)

**6)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-16.jpg)

**8)** Restart your computer and your game.
