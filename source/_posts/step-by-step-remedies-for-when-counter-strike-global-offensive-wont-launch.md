### Fix 1: Reboot your network

 When CS: GO lags, the first thing you should check is your network connection. If there’s something wrong with your network, CS: GO will definitely keep stuttering.

 One of the easiest fixes for games lag issue is to simply **reboot your network** . By rebooting your network, your Internet connection speed may be back to normal. And if everything else is OK, this issue can be resolved after you reboot your network. Here is how to do it:

 1)**Unplug** your modem (and your wireless router, if it’s a separate device) from power for **60 seconds** .

_wireless router_

 2)**Plug in** your network devices again and wait until the indicator lights are back to its normal state.

 Launch CS: GO to see if you fixed this issue. If your CS: GO still lags after you reboot your network, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If CS: GO lag issue is not triggered by network problems, you should try updating your graphics driver to the latest version. An outdated graphics driver can also be the root of the game lag issues.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Manually update the driver** : You should go to the manufacturer website of your graphics card, find the latest version of the driver and install it in your computer.

 Be sure to download the latest correct driver**that is compatible with your exact graphics card model** and **your version of Windows** .

**Or**

**Automatically update the driver** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** come straight from **the manufacturer** . They‘re **all certified safe and secure** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
