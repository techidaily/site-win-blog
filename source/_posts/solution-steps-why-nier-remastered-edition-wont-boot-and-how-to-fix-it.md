Some also**receive some error codes** , preventing them from enjoying the gameplay. If you’re one of them, don’t fret! We’ve gathered some methods for you to identify the root cause and resolve your problems.

## Before going any further…

 Before we dive into troubleshooting, let’s begin by ensuring your system is up to the challenge of running Starfield. Bethesda’s epic space exploration game offers a breathtaking experience, but it requires a certain level of hardware capability to truly shine.

#### Minimum System Requirements

 First, make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements as provided by Bethesda.

| **DirectX**          | Version 12                                 |
| **Storage**          | 125 GB available space                     |
| **Additional Notes** | SSD Required(Solid-state Drive)            |

#### Recommended System Requirements

 For a smoother and more immersive gaming experience, it’s highly recommended to meet or exceed the recommended system requirements.

| **OS**               | Windows 10/11 with updates                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

**Graphics drivers** act as a bridge that allows your operating system and applications, such as Starfield, to interact effectively with your graphics hardware.

 When Starfield or any other game fails to launch, outdated or incompatible graphics drivers can often be a leading cause of the problem.

If you have no idea what kind of graphics card your PC is packing,

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Enter**taskmgr** and press Enter.

After driver updates, it’s a good practice to reboot your device.

 After the reboot, relaunch Starfield. If it still fails to start, proceed to the next fix.

## 2\. Update Windows

 To ensure Starfield opens without interruptions, it’s crucial to keep your Windows updated. Windows updates often include bug fixes, make sure your system is compatible with application requirements, and enhance system stability, reducing conflicts that can hinder game launches.

To download and install the latest Windows updates, take these steps:

### On Windows 11

 Press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings. Then go to**Windows Update** and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the latest updates.

 Press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings. Then go to**Update & Security > Windows Update** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/windows-update-2.jpg)

## 3\. Disable antivirus and firewall

 Your firewall and antivirus are diligent gatekeepers, which is great for overall security. However, they can occasionally misinterpret Starfield’s actions as threats. By turning them off briefly, you can check if they’re blocking the game’s launch.

 _Note: Only disable them temporarily for testing, and remember to re-enable them afterward. Otherwise, your system could be put at risk._

To temporarily disable the Windows Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-to-disable-windows-firewall.png)
3. Click **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .

## 6\. Uninstall and reinstall the game

 If none of the above methods work, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.

 After having the latest version of Starfield installed on your system, launch it and see if you can get into the gameplay.

 However, if you still have difficulty launching Starfield, try this last resort – run a full scan on your PC. Your issue may be**due to the corruption of your system files** .

 To make sure those files are intact, you can use the **System File Checker** (SFC), a utility in Windows that helps check any problematic files and repair them if there are any. Below is the simple step-by-step guide.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .
2. Click **Yes**  when you receive a prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following commands in Command Prompt, then press Enter.  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-run-the-system-file-checker.jpg)
5. Now type **sfc /scannow**  and press Enter. Then it’ll start scanning the integrity of all protected operating system files and replace incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions.
