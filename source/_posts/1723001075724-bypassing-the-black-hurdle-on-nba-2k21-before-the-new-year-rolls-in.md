## 2\. Verify integrity of game files

 Performance issues can occur due to missing or corrupted game files. To check if that’s what caused the black screen issue, you can attempt to verify the game files:

1. Open your Steam client. Under the LIBRARY tab, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

 Then you can launch NBA 2K21\. If verifying game files integrity doesn’t give you any luck, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with the graphics card. If it is outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. Therefore, when your NBA 2K21 is stuck on the black loading screen, you should make sure your graphics card is up-to-date. Driver updates include the latest patches for security flaws, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features, all for free.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) / [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
