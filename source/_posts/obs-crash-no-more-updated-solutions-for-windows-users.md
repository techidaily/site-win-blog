2. **Right-click** on **Tormented Souls** and select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
3. Click **LOCAL FILES** on the left, then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . It may take some time to finish verifying the game files. If Steam finds anything wrong with the game files, it will re-download them from its official server.

![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 When the verifying process completed, Run Tormented Souls and check if this fix works. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. If Tormented Souls keeps crashing on your PC, it indicates that you’re using the corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the game crashing issues.

 You can update your graphics driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) ), and find the latest graphics drivers for your computer.

## Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Tormented Souls releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by the Steam client, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Tormented Souls again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved.

 If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Disable the Steam overlay

 The Steam Overlay is an in-game interface that allows players to access many Steam Community features while playing. The overlay features are handy, but sometimes they may interfere with the game.

 You can try disabling the Steam Overlay for Tormented Souls and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Tormented Souls_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Nvidia GeForce Experience, Discord, Twitch, etc., make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch_Tormented Souls_ and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily Disable 3rd-party antivirus software

 Many 3rd-party antivirus software have the real-time protection feature, which often blocks the game files. Sometimes this may lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application, and turn off the real-time protection feature. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch Tormented Souls and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.

## Stop overclocking

 Some players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking often cause the game to crash.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

See if the game crashing issue persists.
