 You put on your Oculus Rift headset, and you find that it just stops working somehow, and you have no idea why, wondering if it’s bricked. Then you see an error message popping up and say that_**Can’t Reach Oculus Runtime Service**_ .

 As horrifying as it seems, the good news is, your Oculus Rift is not dead, and there are fixes for it. According to Oculus, this error has to do with its expired security certification.

 Here are 2 fixes that you can try. You may not have to try them both; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

1. [**Change the date and time settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. **[Download and run the patch provided by Oculus](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
