### 2\. Use a VPN

 If it’s not a server problem, a VPN may help you fix the issue. Using a VPN would change the server you linked and make a difference. A paid VPN provides you a safe and better internet performance.

[**Express VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) are big brands with good reputations.

 Here we take **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as an example:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN on your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.

4. Relaunch Star War Battlefront 2.

 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.
