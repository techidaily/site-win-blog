### Fix 2: Check the version of the platform apps

 Clownfish Voice Changer is used on Skype, Discord and other apps. So when you’re using the latest Clownfish but it doesn’t work, it could be the platform application problem.

 Check you’ve updated the platform app to the latest version and restart the program again.

### Fix 3: Installing your microphone in clownfish

 To solve the Clownfish Voice Changer not working problem, the microphone should not be ignored. Because the application needs to use your microphone to detect your voice and translating it to the system. With wrongly installed microphones or incorrect, outdated microphone drivers, Clownfish Voice Changer may not work properly.

1. Run Clownfish.
2. Right-click on the**Clownfish** icon in the Taskbar.  
 Note: Click the**^** button if Clownfish was hidden in the Taskbar.

5. Restart your computer and check the app.

**Note** : It’s important to check whether your microphone has the correct and latest driver.

 You can either search the microphone’s official website or use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) with**one click** . Because Windows won’t release the latest drivers in time.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.
