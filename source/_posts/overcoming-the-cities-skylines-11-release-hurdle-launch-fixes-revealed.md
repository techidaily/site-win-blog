### Fix 1: Verify if your PC meets the system requirements for PoE

 First and foremost, you should verify if your computer can handle PoE. Here’s the information you may need:

* MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

| **OS**        | Windows 7 SP1/Windows 8                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor** | x86-compatible 2.6GHz or better                              |
| **Memory**    | 4 GB RAM                                                     |
| **Graphics**  | NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 650 Ti or ATI Radeon™ HD 7850 or better |
| **DirectX**   | Version 11                                                   |
| **Network**   | Broadband Internet connection                                |
| **Storage**   | 32 GB available space                                        |

* RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS

| **OS**        | Windows 10                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | x64-compatible, quad core, 3.2GHz or better                 |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                                                    |
| **Graphics**  | NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1050 Ti or ATI Radeon™ RX560 or better |
| **DirectX**   | Version 11                                                  |
| **Network**   | Broadband Internet connection                               |
| **Storage**   | 32 GB available space                                       |

**Additional Notes:** Solid state storage is recommended

 Once you confirm that your PC is up for the task of running PoE, move down and try out other fixes below. However, if your computer doesn’t meet the requirements for this game, please upgrade some of your hardware components first.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics card drivers

 Your crashing issue with PoE may be caused by outdated or corrupt graphics card drivers. To check if that’s the root cause, you should try updating your graphics driver to a relatively new and stable version first.

 Usually, you can get the latest driver from your video card’s manufacturer (such as [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) , [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ) and then install it by yourself. However, you’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually,   **you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged driver (say your graphics card driver) to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 If you play PoE on Steam, you can verify the integrity of your game files using the following procedure:

 1) Log in Steam and click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x218.png)

 2) Right-click **Path of Exile** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17.png)

 3) Go to the **LOCAL FILES** tab and select **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** . Then wait for the process to be complete.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18.png)

 4) Once complete, exit Steam and reopen it. Run PoE and wait to see if it keeps crashing.

In case this fix didn’t help, please move on to Fix 4.

### Fix 4: Run RoE as an administrator

 This quick fix is more like a general solution for all the games that cannot be launched properly, and it’s very easy to apply. As long as you have the administrative privileges to run RoE, you should give this fix a try.

 1) Locate the **executable file** of RoE (such as PathOfExileSteam.exe) in your PC. Right-click on it and select **Properties** .

 If you cannot find the executable file, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** simultaneously on your keyboard and enter **taskmgr** . Click **OK**  to open the Task Manager.  
 Then, on the **Processes** tab, locate**Path of Exile** in the list of processes, right-click on it, and select **Open file location** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-24.png)

 2) In the Properties window, on the **Compatibility** tab, select **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK** .

<a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19.png)

 Now you should be able to run RoE under administrator privileges permanently. If you want to revert this configuration, simply uncheck **Run this program as an administrator** .

Still unable to solve the problem? If yes, proceed to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Change certain in-game configurations

 According to many players, turning off**Engine Multithreading** and**VSync** under Graphics settings has cleared up the crashing problem for them. Here’s how to do it:

 1) On the Log-in screen, click**OPTIONS** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13.png)

 2) On the**Graphics** tab, disable**Engine Multithreading** and**VSync** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15.png)

 3) Wait to see if the crashing issue reoccurs. If it does, maybe these two features should not be blamed for your trouble, and you can enable them later on.

### Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 To anyone in pursuit of ultimate gaming experience, it’s quite common to speed up the CPU/GPU a notch or two. Usually, it won’t cause you much trouble; just don’t push them too hard – otherwise, the overclocking may undermine the stability of your PC, raising the risks of game crashes and even hardware malfunction (such as overheat).

 If you’re now overclocking your computer, try to stop it for a while and see whether that resolves your crashing problem in PoE. If possible, underclock your GPU a bit and then turn down/off some of the in-game graphics settings. That will release some burden from your hardware and enable the game to run more fluidly, but it’s not essential.

 Hopefully this post helped you resolve the problem. If none of the above fixes work out, you should send a ticket to Grinding Gear Games (the developer of PoE) and ask them for help. Also, feel free to leave a comment below if you have any further questions or ideas. Thanks for reading!
