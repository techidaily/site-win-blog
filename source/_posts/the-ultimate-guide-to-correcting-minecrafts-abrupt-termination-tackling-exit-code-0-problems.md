| **Graphics**  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti  |
| **DirectX**   | Version 12                        |
| **Storage**   | 50 GB available space             |

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Turn off all the background apps then run Halo Infinite to check if the issue persists.

## Fix 5: Change NVIDIA resolution

 Open the NVIDIA control panel and change the resolution from 4k to 1440p. Click**Apply > Yes** to save the change.

 Jump back to the game and check the game. If it’s smooth, no stuttering, you can open NVIDIA control panel and change resolution back to 4K. The game should stay well.
