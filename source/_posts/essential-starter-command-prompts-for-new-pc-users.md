 Do you ever feel like navigating your Windows system is like a never-ending scavenger hunt? You click through endless menus and folders, just trying to find that one file or setting. That's where these commands come in. It’s like having a secret shortcut to get things done faster. Master these 10 basic Windows commands, and you'll not only streamline your workflow but also channel your inner hacker.

 All the commands listed in this article can be used in both Command Prompt and PowerShell.

## 1  cd: Change Directories Easily 

[Navigating the Windows file system](https://howto.techidaily.com/full-solutions-to-fix-error-code-920-in-google-play-on-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) doesn't have to be a maze. The cd (change directory) command makes it easy to move around your directories.

 To use the command, just type **cd** followed by the directory you want to navigate to. Need to quickly jump to your Documents folder from your home directory? Type this command:

cd Documents

![Windows change directory command in the terminal.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cd-2.png) 

 Or maybe you want to go up one level; you can type **cd ..** which will bring you back to the previous directory. This can be useful if you need to navigate through different directories quickly.

![Using the change directory command in Windows to go up one level.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cd_up_one_level.png) 

 You can also navigate to a specific path, no matter where you are, by providing the full path, starting from the root directory. Remember to use the correct syntax and spelling. To navigate to the System32 directory, type this command:

cd C:\Windows\System32

![Using the change directory command in Windows to move to the System32 folder.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cd_to_system32.png) 

 It's all about making your file system a lot more accessible. For a deeper dive into changing directories on Windows, learn [how to change directories in command prompt on Windows 10](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/quick-and-easy-iphone-burst-techniques/).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2  dir: List Directory Contents 

 Do you want to see what's inside a folder without opening it? The dir (directory) command is your answer. It lists all files and directories right in the terminal. Just type **dir** to get a list of everything in the current directory.

![Using the dir command in Windows.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dir_command.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If you type **dir /a**you can see all files and folders, including hidden ones, displayed in the directory.

![Using the dir command in Windows to display hidden directories and files.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dir_see_hidden_files.png) 

 Use the Tab key to auto-complete file and directory names while typing commands, saving time and reducing errors.

## 3  mkdir: Create New Directories 

 Organize your files in a snap with the mkdir (make directory) command. Create new folders wherever you want. Creating a new folder is as simple as typing this command:

mkdir NewFolder

![Using the mkdir command in Windows to create a new directory.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mkdir_newfolder.png) 

 This command is a great way to keep your system organized.

 If you want to create a nested directory structure in one go, you can use the **mkdir a\\b\\c** command. This command will create directory "a," and within "a," it will create directory "b," and within "b," it will create directory "c." It's a convenient way to set up multiple levels of directories with a single command rather than having to create each directory individually.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4  rmdir: Remove Directories 

 Do you have an empty folder you don’t need? The rmdir (remove directory) command will take care of it. But if it’s not empty, you’ll need a different approach. To remove an empty directory, simply type:

rmdir NewFolder

![Using the rmdir command in WIndows to remove a folder.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rmdir_newfolder.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To remove a directory along with everything within it, use the **rmdir /s NewFolder** command.

![Using the rmdir command in Windows to remove a directory and its contents.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rmdir_newfolder_andcontents.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Just be careful with that second one, and make sure you really want everything gone.

 When using the mkdir or rmdir commands, you won't see any confirmation message if the action is successful. To ensure the directory has been created or removed, you can use the dir command to list the contents of the current directory. If the action is successful, the new directory will appear or disappear from the list accordingly.

 If you need more information on a specific command, simply enter help followed by the command. For example, if you need more information on the rmdir command, type the **help rmdir** command.

## 5  del: Delete Files 

 Do you need to delete a file? The del command will do it. Use it wisely because once it's gone, it's gone (sort of). [Deleted files on hard drives aren't immediately erased](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-facebook-viewership-with-obs-broadcasts/), while on solid-state drives, the data may be wiped more quickly.

 To delete a file, type the command del followed by the file(s) you want to delete. For example, to delete file.txt, type this:

del file.txt

![Using the del command in Windows to delete a file.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/del_file.png) 

 It’s a powerful command, so handle it with care.

 The del command doesn't print anything in response to its use, which might surprise you. Once you run the command, the file will be deleted silently. You can verify that the file has been deleted by using the dir command to check the contents of the directory where the file was located.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6  copy: Copy Files to Another Location 

 Do you want to back up your files? The copy command makes duplicating files a breeze. To copy file.txt to the C:\\Backup folder, type the following:

copy file.txt C:\Backup

![Using the copy command in Windows to copy a file to a new location.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/copy_to_another_location.png) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png" border="0">Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Screensaver Factory is very easy to use, and it enables you to make self-installing screensaver files and CDs for easy setup and distribution. Screensaver Factory is the most advanced software of its kind.</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 By using the wildcard symbol "\*" followed by the file extension, you can copy all files with the same extension. For example, to copy all text files to the C:\\Backup directory, you use this command:

copy * .txt C:\Backup

![Using the copy command to copy multiple files in Windows.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/copy_multiple_files.png) 

 Press F7 to view and select from your command history. This allows you to easily re-run previous commands without retyping them.

## 7  move: Move Files to a New Location 

 Are you reorganizing your files? The move command lets you move files around on Windows without having to copy them to a new location. To move a file, use the move command followed by the filename and, finally, the location where you want it moved.

 As an example, to move file.txt to the C:\\Backup folder, type this command:

move file.txt C:\Backup

![Using the move command in Windows to move a file to a new location.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/move_tobackup.png) 

## 8  type: Display the Contents of a Text File 

 Do you want to peek inside a text file without opening it? The type command displays its contents right in the terminal. This can be done by entering type followed by the text file you want to read. To read file.txt, use this command:

type file.txt

![Using the type command in Windows to display the contents of a text file.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/type_file.png) 

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The cls command clears all text from the terminal screen, giving you a clean slate to work from.

## 9  systeminfo: View System Information 

 The systeminfo command provides an [overview of your Windows system](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-music-files-on-redmi-k70-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/), perfect for troubleshooting or satisfying your curiosity. It displays information such as the operating system version, processor type, and installed RAM. It also includes details about the computer's network configuration.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 10  tree: Display Directory Structure 

 The tree command displays a graphical representation of the directory structure of a drive or path. It's a handy way to see the layout of your files and folders. To see the structure of the Users directory, type this command:

tree C:\Users
