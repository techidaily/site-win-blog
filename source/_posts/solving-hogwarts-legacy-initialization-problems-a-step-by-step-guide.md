## Troubleshooting Vanguard's Failed Start-Up Problems in Valorant – Solutions Inside

For many**Valorant** players,**Vanguard Not Initialized** is not an uncommon occurrence. The error pops up when Riot’s anti-cheat program Vanguard fails to start for some reason, causing Valorant to crash. If you, too, are being shut out of the game by the error, don’t worry. This post may help…

## How to fix Vanguard Not Initialized

 Here are five fixes that have helped other players resolve the**Vanguard Not Initialized** game crash on PC error. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. [Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Re-launch Riot Vanguard](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Reinstall Riot Vanguard](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Set Virtual Disk Service to automatic](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fix 1\. Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card is the heart and soul for games like Valorant. If the game constantly crashes on your PC, it is likely that the graphics driver on your computer is outdated or corrupt. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the crashing issue.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by going to the manufacturer’s website ([**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) | **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), finding the latest driver package and installing it step by step. If you don’t have the time or patience to download and install manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.
5. Launch Valorant, then check to see if the game crashing problem has been resolved. If yes, then great! If the issue still persist, please try**Fix 2** , below.

## Fix 2: Re-launch Riot Vanguard

 Sometimes a simple restart could help fix lots of hiccups. So as an empirical method, you can force quit the program and give Riot Vanguard a re-launch. Then restart your computer and check to see if the game still crashes.
