Recently many players reported Star Wars Squadrons crashing on PC when they were flying the starfighters or completing a mission. If you also run into the game crashing issue, don’t worry. In this post, we’ll walk you through all the possible fixes and help you get back to the virtual spaces easily.

## How to fix Star Wars Squadrons crashing

 You don’t need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that solves your problem.

1. **[Run Star Wars Squadrons as an administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Verify the integrity of your game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Turn off overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Adjust the graphics settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Please first check out **[Star Wars Squadrons minimum requirements](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/squadrons/overview/pc-system-requirements)**  to ensure your rig is able to handle the game. Otherwise, you need to upgrade the PC for enjoyable gameplay.

### Fix 1 – Run Star Wars Squadrons as an administrator

 In some cases, Star Wars Squadrons requires elevated permissions to work as intended, or else it crashes randomly. To run the game in the administrator mode, follow the steps below:

**1)** Right-click the**Star Wars Squadrons icon** on your desktop and click**Properties** .

Check if the game runs normally now. If not, move on to the second fix.

### Fix 2 – Verify the integrity of your game files

 Star Wars Squadrons crashing may be caused by missing or corrupted game files. So an integrity check is necessary at the very start. We’ll show you how to do this both on **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[Origin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### If you’re playing on Steam

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes are usually driver-related and can indicate a wrong, faulty or outdated graphics driver. To keep Star Wars Squadrons running smoothly and boost the game’s performance, you should update your graphics driver to the latest.

There are mainly two ways you can do the driver update:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can search for the most recent graphics driver on your GPU manufacturer’s websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then download the driver corresponding with your Windows version, and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
