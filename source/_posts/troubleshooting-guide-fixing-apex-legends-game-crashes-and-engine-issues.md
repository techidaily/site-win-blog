4. Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.

 Once the process is finished, launch Insurgency: Sandstorm to see if the game crashes again.

If the game keeps crashing, move on to the next fix.

Launch the game again to check if your problem is resolved.

If the crashing issue remains, check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 **One of the most common causes of game crashes is that you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver.** To fix the potential problem and get the best performance, you should make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and launch Insurgency: Sandstorm to see if the game crashes again.

 If updating your graphics driver doesn’t help, proceed to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Reset the video settings

 Some players have reported that they fixed the crashing issue by resetting the video settings. You can give it a try. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then, type**%AppData%\\..\\Local** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/appdata-local.jpg)
2. Navigate to**Insurgency > Saved > Config > WindowsClient** .

3. Delete the**GameUserSettings.ini** file.

 Relaunch Insurgency: Sandstorm and all your video settings should be reset to default. Check if the crashing issue is resolved.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, continue to the next one.

### Fix 5: Close background applications

 The applications running in the background can slow down your PC and cause interference with your games, which may lead to the crashing issue. If you’ve CCleaner or MSI Afterburner installed, make sure they’re disabled in the background. Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up**Task Manager** .
2. **Right-click** the applications that may interfere with your game and click**End task** .

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

Launch Insurgency: Sandstorm to see if the game crashes again.

If the crashing issue persists, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 6: Allow the game through Windows Firewall

 The Windows Firewall can block the normal operation of certain programs, which may cause the game to crash. To ensure Insurgency: Sandstorm works properly on your PC, you should allow the game through Windows Firewall. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**firewall.cpl** and click**OK** .

Once done, relaunch the game to see if it crashes again.

### Fix 7: Change the screen resolution to 1080p (PS4 Pro)

 With the[new patch](https://newworldinteractive.com/insurgency-sandstorm-patch-4/) being released, the crashing issues that affected all consoles should be resolved. But PS4 Pro and PS5 players are still unable to play games in 4K. As a temporary workaround, setting the console’s resolution to 1080p and turning off Supersampling should help to fix the crashing issue on your PS4 Pro.
