 Note that**some antivirus software still works when disabled** , so you can temporarily uninstall it or add Ghostrunner to its exception list.

### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 The main reason why Ghostrunner’s fatal error happens is tied to the GPU driver. If your game crashes, won’t launch, or gives you any kinds of errors, be sure to update your graphics card driver and other drivers.

### Fix 3: Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2013

 1) Visit[Microsoft Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) center.

 2) Scroll down to the download section for**Visual Studio 2013** , and click **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013** .

 5) Run these two downloaded files and follow the on-screen instructions to install.

 6) Once complete, restart your computer for it to take full effect.

Play Ghostrunner again to see if this fatal error reoccurs.

### Fix 4: Stop overclocking

 Another reason that you get Ghostrunner fatal error is GPU overclocking. If you overclocked your GPU with some software such as Afterburner, we recommend stopping the overclock or suspending these programs including GeForce Experience before you play the game.

 If the fix above doesn’t help, you can lock the game’s maximum FPS:

 1) Right-click your desktop and select**Nvidia Control Panel** .
