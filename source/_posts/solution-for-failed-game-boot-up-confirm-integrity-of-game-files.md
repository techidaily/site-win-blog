### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 If you’re using a wrong or out-of-date graphics driver, your gaming experience with Mafia Definitive Edition may feel like a glitchy ride. To let the game launch smoothly and run at the first-class condition at all times, you should install the latest GPU driver.

 There are two ways you can update the graphics driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep updating drivers to fix compatibility issue with new games. To get them, you need to go to their official websites ( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  or **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  ) , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-1-7.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-2-13.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Fix 6 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Many users install antivirus to protect their computers from potential threats or attacks. If you do too, make sure your antivirus doesn’t identify your game as malware by mistake and blocks it from launching.

 Simply turn off the antivirus for a while and see if the game is able to start. If yes, you need to**whitelist Mafia Definitive Edition** so that you can use both without trouble.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
