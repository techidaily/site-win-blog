### Fix 1: Check server status

 I recommend you to check if there’s server maintenance first. The[@MLBTheShow](https://twitter.com/MLBTheShow) is the first place to check. Avoid playing at the server maintenance time.

> The server issue from earlier tonight has been resolved. We have scheduled another server maintenance for 4 AM PT on Wednesday 4/28/21\. Please complete all games prior to that. Thank you for your continued support.

 If you can’t find the information about server maintenance, google for a third-party website for more information.

 There’s nothing you can do instead of waiting. If there are no server issues, you can move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Reboot the game and device

 Reboot the game is an easy but working fix for many game issues. Simply go to the home page of your console and close the game completely. Then restart it and see if it’s fixed or not.

If it’s not working, restart your console might work as a shine.

### Fix 3: Use VPN

 If your internet connection is slow, use a wired connection would help. Plus, use a VPN may fix the issue. It’s because VPN allows you to receive a superior gaming experience by reducing ping and protecting your information.

 You can easily set up NordVPN on your PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox via your Windows PC or router. Once connect, you’re free to enjoy a seamless gaming experience with robust anti-DDoS protection.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install the NordVPN app on your laptop or desktop.
2. Connect the app to the VPN server.
3. Press**Windows logo key + I** together and click**Network & Internet** .
