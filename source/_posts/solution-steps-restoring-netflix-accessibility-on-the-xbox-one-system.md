### Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the system requirements for DayZ

 DayZ crashing issue often occurs when the specs of your PC fails to meet the system requirements for DayZ. Before trying other fixes, you should make sure your PC meet the minimum system requirements for the game.

Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**  | Intel Core i5-4430                    |
| **Memory:**     | 8 GB RAM                              |
| **Graphics:**   | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X |

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |

### Fix 5: Turn off Steam Overlay

 The Steam Overlay may interfere with DayZ, and sometimes it may even crash the game. Some DayZ players reported that after disabling Steam Overlay, the crashing issue disappears. You can follow the steps below to turn off Steam Overlay:

1. In Steam, click the**Steam** tab on the upper left corner and select**Settings** to open the Settings page of the Steam client.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-settings.png)
2. Navigate to the**In-Game** tab, then_**untick**_ **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** . Click**OK** to save the change.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-Settings2.png)

 Run DayZ again after you disabled Steam Overlay to see if you can play the game without crashes. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat. You can try   **adding DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 See if you can run DayZ without crashes. If not, try the next fix below to reinstall the game.

### Fix 7: Reinstall DayZ

 If none of the fixes works, you may need to reinstall DayZ to fix this issue. To reinstall DayZ:

1. Open Steam and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. **Right-click** DayZ and select **Delete Local Content…** . to uninstall the game.
