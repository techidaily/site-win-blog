 It may simply be caused by your internet connection, especially when others are not having this issue.

2) Leave them for at least 30 seconds.

### Fix 3\. Use a VPN

 A VPN can help establish better connections in Escape from Tarkov. Many players find it can really reduce crashes to some extent. Otherwise, they get kicked out all the time.

 You can choose a reliable free VPN or a paid VPN such as[**Nord VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (a[**70% off coupon**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is available now), which comes with 24/7 customer support and a 30-day free trial.

 The difference between a free VPN and a paid one is the ping. Tarkov’s servers are extremely sensitive to any latency or ping fluctuation. So be sure to choose the VPN with the lowest ping.

### Fix 5\. Update your network drivers

 If the network adapter driver you’re using is faulty or outdated, you will possibly encounter this ‘Server Connection Lost’ error in Escape from Tarkov. To fix the potential problems and enjoy ensure less lagging, you should install the latest network driver on your computer.

**Manually –** To update your network adapter driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

### Fix 6\. Switch to a static IP

 Instead of letting your router assign whatever IP address is free at any given time, you can assign specific IP addresses to the devices you access frequently. And this turns out to be a temporary fix for ‘**Server Connection Lost** ‘ for a few Escape from Tarkov players. Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win + R** at the same time and enter**ncpa.cpl** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ncpa.jpg)

 2) Right-click your active connection, and select**Status** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ipv-4-change.jpg)

 7) Select the**Use the following IP address** option, and then type in the IP address, subnet mask you acquired earlier. Next, type in your preferred and alternate DNS server addresses.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dns-and-ipv4.jpg)

 8) Click**OK** to save the changes.

 9) You can verify your new settings by using the `**ipconfig**` command at the command prompt.

 Try launching your game and test the issue. But if unfortunately, the Tarkov Server connection lost error persists, you can try the following fix.

### Fix 7\. Change from DS-Lite to Dual-Stack

 If none of these methods above fix your issue, you can ask your Internet service provider to change from DS Lite to Dual Stack. This has been proved helpful to many players, though it has varying success.

 Dual-Stack allows a device to run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel, while DS-Lit (Dual-Stack Lite) is a technology that enables Internet service providers to move to an IPv6 network while simultaneously handling IPv4 address depletion.
