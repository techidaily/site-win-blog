4) Relaunch your computer and the game to see if the problem is resolved.

If the problem persists, read on and try the fix below.

## Fix 2: Verify the Integrity of Game Files

 You won’t be able to run the game correctly if any critical game files are damaged or missing. To see if this is the core issue, you can verify the integrity of game files from Steam:

1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click MIR4 and select **Properties** .

 3) Under the **LOCAL FILES** tab, click **Verify integrity of game files** . (This process may take several minutes. Steam will fix corrupted files automatically if it detects any.)

4) Restart the game after the process is complete.

## Fix 3: Update Your Graphics Driver

 One of the most common causes of the game crashing problem is a missing or outdated graphics driver. Try updating your driver to see if it fixes the issue.

There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 3) Restart your computer after the update is complete, then try running MIR4 again.

If the issue persists, try the fix, below.

## Fix 8: Wait for Patch Notes

 If none of the fixes worked for you, chances are the problem is at MIR4’s end. The developers of MIR4 release regular game patches to resolve bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from launching correctly, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 Wait for the patch note to be released or you can also contact the MIR4 support team for assistance.
