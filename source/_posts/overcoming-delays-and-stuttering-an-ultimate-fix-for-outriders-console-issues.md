## 1\. Install all Windows updates

![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/check-for-updates.png)
2. Click**Check for updates** . If there are any updates available, it’ll automatically start to download and install it. Once the download is finished, restart your PC.  

![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/click-on-the-Check-for-updates-tab.png)  

 After the reboot, launch NARAKA: BLADEPOINT and check if your game looks better. If your problems persist, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Disable unnecessary programs

 Too many programs running in the background will most likely drain your system as they take up a certain amount of resources. To get a better gaming experience, you’re supposed to disable those programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint.

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo + R keys simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste**taskmgr** and press Enter to open the Task Manager.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the Processes tab, right-click the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint and select**End task** .

 (Be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly. )  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-programs-running-in-the-backgroundend-task.jpg)  

 After you’ve done these, play your game. If you’re still having sudden extreme framerate drops and stuttering during the gameplay, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Enable the Game Mode

 Players who have the latest Windows version should enable the Game Mode, a feature that is designed to optimize Windows 10 for gaming. It can deactivate background activities to help you boost in-game FPS. To enable the Game Mode, follow the instructions below.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Select**Gaming** .

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 As described above, manually updating your graphics driver would require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 When you’re having performance issues, verifying game files may work like magic. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files are intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or replace any corrupted files. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-properties.jpg)
2. Select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . Then wait for the process to complete.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856" border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/verify-integrity-of-game-files-1.png)  

 The verification process would take several minutes to finish. After that, play Naraka: Bladepoint to check if your problems have been solved. If you are still having these problems, proceed to the next fix.

## 6\. Disable overlays

 Overlay technology is commonly used in various programs. It allows you to surf the web and enjoy other features, but can also cause performance issues with some games. Therefore, you may need to disable Steam overlay and check if it can give you a boost in average FPS and reduce in-game stutters. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** from the sidebar and select **Settings** .  

![disable Steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Steam-overlay-1.jpg)
3. Click**In-Game** . Uncheck the box**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.  

![disable Steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Steam-overlay-2.jpg)  

 After saving the changes, launch your game and you should be able to get more FPS and reduce in-game stutters. Also, if you have Discord installed, try to disable overlay by following the steps below.

1. Open Discord.
2. Click the **cogwheel icon** at the bottom of the left pane to open Settings.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-2-1-1.jpg)
3. Select the **Game Overlay** tab in the left pane and toggle off **Enable in-game overlay** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Optimize NVIDIA Control Panel settings

 If you’re using a NVIDIA graphics card, you can optimize the settings through the NVIDIA Control Panel:

1. From your desktop, right-click the empty space and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/from-the-desktop.png)
2. Click**Manage 3D settings** . Then select**Program Settings** . Add**NARAKA: BLADEPOINT** to the list. Under the section Specify the settings for this program, make the following changes:  

 Power management mode:**Prefer maximum performance**  
 Vertical sync:**Off** .
