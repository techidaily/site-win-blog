The default installation folder: C:/Battlestate Games/EFT (live)

 2) Right-click**EscapeFromTarkov** application and select**Properties** .

 3) Go to the**Compatibility** tab, and check the box**Run this program as an administrator** is checked.

### Fix 2\. Disable unnecessary applications

 Another basic troubleshooting is to make sure there’s no interference from other apps, especially from your antivirus software and apps with overlay features such as Discord. Here’s how:

 1) Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager, and end all the unrelated processes.

 2) Some antivirus software will continue working after being disabled. You can add your game to its exception list or temporarily uninstall it.

 3) Allow Escape from Tarkov to run through the Windows Defender Firewall.

* Press the**Windows logo** key +**R** to open the Run box.
* Enter**firewall.cpl** in the box.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/allow-firewall.jpg)
* Make sure the**Private** and**Public** boxes are both checked for Escape from Tarkov and the anti-cheat service BattlEye. If they’re not on the list, click**Change settings** and add them here.

 If you want to close all other programs not related to Windows, you may need to perform a clean boot. Follow[this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for instructions.

4) Now you can try launching your game again to test the issue.

### Fix 3\. Verify your game files

 This is a workaround you need to try in case that your game files get corrupted, which may lead to this error message ‘Anticheat connection failed’. To verify the files, here’s how:

1) Open the game launcher.

2) Under your profile name, click the down arrow key and then select**Integrity check** .

 Before you try reinstalling the whole game, you may want to check if Battle Eye is causing the ‘Anticheat connection failed’ error:

4) Once complete, go back to the game installation folder again. Open the**BattleEye** folder, and double-click the**Install\_BattleEye.bat** .

5) Now launch your game and check if the issue has been resolved.

### Fix 6\. Update all your device drivers

 When it’s quite hard to troubleshoot the exact cause, we would recommend keeping all your device drivers up to date, including your graphics drivers and network adapter drivers. This would also keep your game from bumping into possible crashes in the future.

 There are mainly two methods for you to update the device drivers (here we take graphics driver for an example):

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged network adapter driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click _Update All_ .)

 4) Once the driver is updated, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7\. Reboot your router/modem

 The ‘**Anticheat server connection lost** ‘ can also be caused by network issues. First, you need to make sure you’ve selected the server with the lowest ping. If this doesn’t work, you’d better restart your router.

 Just power off your router for some time and start it normally. Now you can log in again and try playing it again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8\. Use a VPN

 If you have tried all these workarounds above and still you get the ‘Anticheat connection failed’ error in Escape from Tarkov, the best (temporary) solution is to use a VPN with a reasonable ping.

 Using VPN, in general, is terrible for your ping, so it’s important to choose one that really works well with your game. Here we recommend[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ([check the 80% off coupon](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), which also offers a 30-day free trial. You can use the VPN as a temporary fix and wait for the developers to work on a real fix.
