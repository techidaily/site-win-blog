 Now the date and time on your computer is in sync with an Internet time server. Try logging in Origin and see if the error is gone. Hopefully it is. But if not, then try Fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 Perhaps you’re experiencing the Origin error because you’re using a**wrong or outdated device driver** . You should update your drivers and see if this fixes your error.

 There are two ways you can try to update your drivers: manually or automatically…

**Download and install your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the hardware manufacturers’ websites, and searching for the latest drivers for your devices. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd0366bd75a4.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to your device to download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it. Or click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all the drivers. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

2. Type “devmgmt.msc” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.
