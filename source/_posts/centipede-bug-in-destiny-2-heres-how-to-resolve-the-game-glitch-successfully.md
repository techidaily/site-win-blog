### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, game crashes are graphics related. In other words, the constant crashes could indicate you’re using a**buggy or outdated graphics driver** . New drivers usually tackle compatibility issues, so always make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver.

 Of course you can update your drivers manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), then search, download and install the driver step by step. But if you don’t like fiddling with device drivers, you can leave it to[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
