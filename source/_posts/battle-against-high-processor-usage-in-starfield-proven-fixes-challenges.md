### Fix 2: Reinstall Mystic Light completely

 This issue may suggest a misconfiguration or a faulty installation. Either way, you can try to solve the problem with a clean reinstall.

 Mystic Light is a component of**MSI Center** or**Dragon Center (UWP)** , so in fact you’ll be reinstalling one of these two programs.

 For example,**here’s how you can reinstall Dragon Center** :

1. First you need to**purge Dragon Center from your system** . On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the I key) and click Apps.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-settings-apps.jpg)
2. Under**Apps & features** , click the input box and type**Dragon Center** . Select**Dragon Center** and click**Uninstall** .

If this trick doesn’t help you, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 More often than not, the Mystic Light not working issue could indicate a faulty or missing device driver. In addition to healthy hardware, for the ambient lights to work properly, you also need to**make sure you have all the latest necessary drivers** on your rig.

 You can install or update your drivers manually, by visiting the hardware manufacturer’s websites, finding the latest correct drivers and installing them one by one. But if you don’t like playing with computer drivers, you can use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan, repair or update all your drivers automatically.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/de-update-all-realtek-audio.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating all the drivers, restart your PC and check if Mystic Light works now.

 If the latest drivers don’t give you luck, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 4:**Install all Windows updates**

 In some cases, after you install new hardware, Windows will download compatible drivers and files for the hardware to work. But you also need to check if your system is missing important updates.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

### Fix 5: Make sure to disable anti-cheats

 According to some users, Mystic Light may be blocked by some**anti-cheats** such as**Riot Vanguard** and**FACEIT** . So you can check if you have certain online games installed on your system, like Valorant and CSGO.

 Or you can do a clean boot to start your system with only the essential services and programs to check if it’s a compatibility issue:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
