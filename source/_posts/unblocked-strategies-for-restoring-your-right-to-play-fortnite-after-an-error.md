## Before you start

 Please**install the latest game patch** and**ensure your operating system is up to date** whenever playing Minecraft on your PC. Besides, you should**check Minecraft’s minimum requirements** and see if your device is powerful enough to run on the game. If it doesn’t, there is no surprise the stuttering happens.

| Operating System | Windows 7 or up                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| CPU              | Intel Core i3-3210 or AMD A8-7600 APU   |
| GPU              | Intel HD Graphics 4000 or AMD Radeon R5 |
| Memory           | 4 GB RAM                                |

 After confirming your PC is good enough for Minecraft, then go ahead with the fixes below.

## Fix 1: Make sure Minecraft is using the dedicated GPU

 Sometimes the operating system won’t recognize Minecraft as a game and won’t run it with the dedicated GPU for high performance. If that’s the case for you, you’re likely to experience stuttering in Minecraft. To fix it, you can force the game to use the dedicated GPU via Graphics settings. Here’s how:

1. Right-click your desktop and select**Display settings** from the menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/high-performance-3.jpg)

 Once done, run Minecraft again and see if the stuttering issue still appears.

If this solution doesn’t help, continue with the next fix below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Minecraft is a graphics-intensive game, so your graphics card is essential for its performance. You cannot have an outdated or faulty driver on your graphics card since this is usually what causes stuttering in Minecraft. To update your graphics driver, there are two ways you can try: manually and automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](http://nvidia.com/drivers) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ,[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Fix 3: Lower your Render Distance

 In Minecraft, chunks make up your world. And the render distance controls how many chunks of the world are visible at once. So if you set a high value of chunks, you may face the issue of fps drops or stuttering. To get better performance, you should lower the value to 8 or less, depending on your PC’s hardware. Here’s how:

1. Run Minecraft on your computer.
2. Click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/options.jpg)
3. Click**Video Settings** .

4. Lower the**Render distance** according to your need.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/render-distance-1.jpg)

This should give you a better game experience.

But if it doesn’t, take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 4: Enable VSync

 Sometimes the stuttering issue might occur due to a frame rate discrepancy between the monitor and GPU. But luckily you can fix it by enabling VSync in your graphics control panel.

### Via NVIDIA Control Panel

1. Right-click your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left panel, select**Manage 3D Settings** , then click the dropdown menu next to**Vertical sync** and select**On** . Click**Apply** to save changes.

4. Click**Wait for Vertical Refresh** , then select**Enhanced Sync** from the dropdown menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/enhanced-sync-1.jpg)

 After you’ve done these, relaunch Minecraft to check if the stuttering persists.

If enabling Vsync didn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Turn off threaded optimization

 Threaded optimization is a setting in NVIDIA Control Panel that controls the use of multithreaded optimization for all 3D games on systems with multi-core/HyperThreaded CPUs. Most new games perform better with threaded optimization enabled. However, some gamers reported that they fixed the stuttering issue in Minecraft by turning off threaded optimization. You can give it a shot. To do so:

1. Right-click your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** from the menu.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/step1.jpg)
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the list and find the**Threaded optimization** , then click the dropdown menu next to it and**change the value from Auto to Off** . Click**Apply** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/step2.jpg)

After doing so, restart Minecraft and check if the problem is resolved.

If the stuttering issue remains, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Allocate more RAM

 The RAM helps computers improve frame rates and frame pacing during gaming. In many cases, you need to allocate more RAM to games, especially for the games that use a lot of mods, like Minecraft. To do so:

1. Open your**Minecraft client** and navigate to the**Installations** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Installations1.jpg)
2. Click the**three dots** button next to Minecraft, then select**Edit** from the dropdown menu.

## Fix 7: Uninstall OptiFine

 OptiFine is a Minecraft optimization mod, which allows the game to run faster and look better. However, it consumes some resources and may cause the stuttering issue. To see if that’s the case for you, you can try uninstalling OptiFine.

 If the stuttering issue remains after uninstalling OptiFine, check out the last fix.

## Fix 8: Reinstall Minecraft

 If none of the methods above seem to work for you, try reinstalling the game as a last resort. First, uninstall the current version of Minecraft from your computer, then reinstall the latest version of it. After that, relaunch the game to check if the stuttering issue is solved.
