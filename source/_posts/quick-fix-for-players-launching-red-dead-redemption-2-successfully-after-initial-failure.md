### Fix 2: Disable antivirus software

 If you have the latest drivers installed but still have a problem playing the game, the culprit could be your antivirus software.

 Players find it helps by disabling or uninstalling their antivirus app. If you don’t want to disable your antivirus, you can add the entire folder where Red Dead Redemption 2 is installed to its list of exclusions.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics drivers

 Rockstar Games says the most common cause of**Red Dead Redemption 2** not loading problem is outdated graphics drivers. NVIDIA and AMD work closely with game developers to keep releasing new drivers to boost performance and fix bugs.

 To improve your gaming experience, you should always update your graphics drivers to the latest version.

**Note:** You may as well try**updating Windows** to the latest version. In addition, make sure to update your game launcher and Red Redemption 2.

There are two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

#### Option 1 – Manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, you need to visit the manufacturer’s official website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download the exact driver for your device and install it manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **All the drivers in Driver Easy come straight from the manufacturer. They’re all authorized and secure.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![click scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/scan-now-3.png)

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** .)

![update all drivers with driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/update-all-your-drivers-1.jpg)

Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Launch the game again to see if**Red Dead Redemption 2** continues to get stuck on the loading screen.

---

### Fix 4: Delete Settings

 Many users find it works by deleting the configuration file. This will reset your game settings and let your**Red Dead Redemption 2** start again.

 1) Go to **Documents> Rockstar Games> Red Dead Redemption 2> Settings** and delete the setting file:**system.xml** .

**Tips:** There’s a lot of issues with Vulkan and DX12, you can try both and see what works better for you. Vulcan works better for me and my game runs flawlessly.

2) Launch your game again to test the issue.

 If**Red Dead Redemption 2** works like a charm, then congrats! If the loading issue still persists, you can try to delete your local Rockstar Games Launcher profile details.

 3) Open your Rockstar Games Launcher, go to**SETTINGS** \>**Account information** \>**DELETE** local profile.

![delete Rockstar launcher profiles](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/launcher-settings-1024x482.jpg)

 4) Sign in to the Rockstar Games Launcher again and launch Red Dead Redemption 2.

If this method doesn’t work for you, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Run Red Dead Redemption 2 as admin

 Running Red Dead Redemption 2 as an administrator allows you to get full access to the game files.

1) Navigate to where the game is installed.

2) Right-click on**RDR2.exe** and select**Properties** .

3) Click the**Compatibility** tab, tick both**Run this Program as an Administrator** and**Disable Fullscreen Optimizations** .

### Fix 8: Perform a clean boot

 If Red Dead Redemption still fails to load, it may be caused by other software on your PC. You may need a clean boot to see if that’s your issue. Here is how to do it:

 1) Type**msconfig** in the Search box and select**System Configuration** .

![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/system-configuration.jpg)

 2) Click the **Services** tab and check the **Hide all Microsoft services** box, then click **Disable all** .

 5) Go back to**System Configuration** , click**OK** .

 6) Restart your PC and launch Red Redemption 2 to see if the issue still persists.

 If you can start your game again, congrats! However, you’ll need to find out the problematic software. Here is how to do it:

* Open the System Configuration again.
* Enable services and applications that you’ve disabled one by one until you find the problematic one.
* After enabling each startup application, you need to restart your computer again to find the conflicting one.

 Once you find out the problematic software, you may need to uninstall it to avoid running into the same issue in the future.

### Fix 9: Repair your system files

 It’s very likely that some system files are corrupt or missing, and your game is sharing the same files, thus causing your Red Dead Redemption to get stuck on the loading screen. To restore these files, here’s how:

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

#### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your personal data.

##### Step 1\. Scan**corrupt files with System File Checker**

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
