## Fix 2: Update graphics driver

 **The broken or outdated graphics driver may also be the main culprit** behind the game crashing issues. As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping), and even screen flickering issues.

 To fix the game crashing issue caused by an outdated/ broken graphics driver, you can try updating your graphics driver to the latest version.

 The latest graphics driver will**enhance your graphics card performance** and**unlock the full potential of your graphics card** , which will give you an edge in PC video games.

There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel keep updating their graphics drivers. To get them, you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64-bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**Or**

### Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Driver Easy Scan Now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You need to restart your PC after you finish updating your graphics driver.

 Launch the game to see if it crashes or not. Normally, after you update the graphics driver, the game crashing issue will disappear.

 If the latest graphics driver fails to stop the crash, just read on to try the next fix, below.

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 Hazelight (the developer of It Takes Two) releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch It Takes Two to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Add the game as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 If you have 3rd party antivirus software installed on your computer, make sure you’ve added It Takes Two as an exception to your antivirus software, because those third-party antivirus software hooks very deep into your system, and it may interfere with the game.

 Since the game consumes a lot of memory, CPU, and GPU usage, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and the game may not run as expected.

 You can try adding both the game and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, you can also try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before you play the game.

 See if the game crashes after you add it as an exception to your antivirus software. If it persists, try the next fix, below.

New versions support AI-assisted writing.</a>

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking / turbo boosting

 Many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer’s specifications.

 If this issue persists after you stop overclocking, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Update or reinstall DirectX files

 Most games require DirectX 11 to run properly, and It Takes Two is no exception. If there’s a problem with DirectX, the game would crash on startup. If that’s the case, updating the DirectX to the latest version may help. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to[the Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtime Web Install page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .
2. Click the Download button to start the download.  
![download latest DirectX](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-latest-DirectX.jpg)
3. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded**.exe** file to install it on your computer.

 See if the game crashing issue reappears. If not, congratulations, you’ve fixed this issue!

 If none of the fixes work for you, you may need to reinstall It Takes Two. Normally, after reinstalling the game, you’ll be able to fix the crashing issue.
