### Fix 2: Disable overclocking

 Are you running any OC software like MSI Afterburner? Shut it down. Don’t make your PC overhot is a way to fix the Chivalry 2 crashing problem. Gamers have reported that after underclocked or disable overclocking software, the game stops crashing.

 What’s more, you have to end MSI Afterburner, RivaTuner OSD, and other RGB software on the Task Manager even you’ve turned them off. It’s because they will continue to work and take system resources in the background.

1. Right-click on the Taskbar and click**Task Manager** .
2. Turn off all unnecessary and resource-heavy applications.
3. Restart the game and check.

No luck with this one? Move to the next.

### Fix 3: Update your drivers

 There will be crashes when you have driver issues. If you’re using an outdated or corrupted driver, crashes or other issues will come to you. However, Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. There’s a possibility your current graphics card driver isn’t cooperative with Windows 10.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-chivalry-2-crash/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 4: Disable firewall/ antivirus software

 Chivalry 2 requires players to connect the server to play. If the firewall on your system blocks the way, the game crash would happen. Disable the firewall or antivirus software to see the difference.

 It’s hard for malware to create as critical issues as this one certainly is, but lately, we see several crypto-mining malware hijacking your CPU resources. For that purpose, we advise you to conduct a thorough scan with either Windows Defender or any third-party antivirus you have at your control. Many third-party options will scan your computer and successfully get rid of any malware they find.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + I (i)** together to open**Settings** .
2. Click **Settings** \> **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
3. Select**Windows Security** , in the **Firewall & Network Protection** tab, select **Network Profile** .

4. Turn settings off in **Microsoft Defender** **Firewall** .
5. Relaunch the game to see if Chivalry 2 would crash or not.

 If it’s working, whitelist the game into the firewall or antivirus software. Don’t forget to turn on the firewall and your antivirus software.
