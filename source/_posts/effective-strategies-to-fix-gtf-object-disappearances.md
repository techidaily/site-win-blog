### Fix 1:**Log in and out of Steam Client**

 The Steam Fatal Error may just be a hiccup of Steam Client. You can try logging out and back in to see if it returns to normal.

Here is how to re-login to Steam:

1. In the upper left corner of your screen, click**Steam > Change** **Account…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LOG-OUT-IN.png)
2. Click**LOGOUT** to continue.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LOG-OUT.png)
3. Fire up Steam Client and sign in to your account.
4. Open the faulty game to see if it works properly. If yes, then great! If the error still pops up, move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2:**Verify Integrity of Game Files**

 You may run into this error if the files of the game you’re playing are faulty or corrupt. So you can verify the integrity of the game files (of the problematic game) to compare the files on your PC to the ones on Steam servers. If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Once finished, launch the game to see if it can be played properly. If yes, congrats! If it’s still no joy, please continue with**Fix 3** . below.

### Fix 3: Set the faulty game in compatability mode

 Your current version of the game in question may be released prior to your version of Windows, which may cause the fatal error. If this is the case, you can run the game in compatibility mode.

1. Open Steam Client.
2. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-1.png)

### Fix 4: Update your device drivers

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png)

1. In your desktop, right-click on**your Steam shortcut** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s.png)

### Fix 8: Reinstall Steam

 If you’ve exhausted all possible fixes but the error still happens, you can reinstall Steam as a last resort. Many players may fear this would delete all installed games, but you can easily save them by backing up the Steamapps folder – that way you wouldn’t need to redownload a single game after reinstalling Steam.

**To back up the Steamapps folder:**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Windows-logo-key.jpg) and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer, then copy and paste**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`** into the address bar and press**Enter** . This will open the installation directory of Steam.
