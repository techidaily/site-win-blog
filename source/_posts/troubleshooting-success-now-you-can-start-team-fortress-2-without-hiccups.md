### **Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum hardware requirements**

 The Fortnite stuttering issue may occur if your PC fails to meet the minimum hardware requirements of the game. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements:

* **The minimum hardware requirements for Fortnite:**

| **CPU:**           | Core i3 2.4 Ghz       |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **RAM:**           | **4** GB              |
| **OS:**            | Windows 7/8/10 64-bit |
| **Graphics card:** | Intel HD 4000         |

 As we all know, it’s never the ideal way to play Fortnite with a PC which just meets its minimum hardware requirements. So we also list the recommended system requirements for Fortnite below.

* **The recommended system requirements for Fortnite:**

| **CPU:**           | Core i5 2.8 Ghz                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RAM:**           | **8** GB                                                        |
| **OS:**            | Windows 7/8/10 64-bit                                           |
| **Graphics card:** | **Nvidia GTX 660** or**AMD Radeon HD 7870** equivalent DX11 GPU |

 You may need to**upgrade your hardware** if your PC fails to meet the minimum system requirements of the game.

### **Fix 2: Install the latest patch**

### **Fix 3: Update your graphics driver**

 A missing or outdated graphics driver in your computer can cause the Fortnite stuttering issue, so make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver: **manually** and **automatically** .

**Manually update the driver** : You should go to the manufacturer website of your graphics card, find the latest version of the driver and install it in your computer.

 Be sure to download the latest correct driver**that is compatible with your exact graphics card model** and**your version of Windows** .

**Or**

**Automatically update the driver** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** come straight from**the manufacturer** . They‘re**all certified safe and secure** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap53.jpg)
3. Click **Update** next to your graphics card to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee).
