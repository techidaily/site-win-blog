### Fix 2: Avoid CPU overheating

 If your computer CPU is overheating, you’re likely to have the crashing issue in GTA 5, because your computer can’t work normally when being overheating, especially when it has to deal with the game running. So have a check on your computer and make sure it’s not overheating.

 If you’re CPU is overheating,**clean out your computer case** and guarantee a**proper ventilation** . You can shut down your computer for a while until it’s getting cool and able to process normally.

### Fix 5: Turn on VSync

 VSync stands for Vertical Sync, which is a display option in 3D PC games. It allows you to synchronize the frame rate with the monitor refresh rate for better stability. Having VSync on in GTA 5 has been reported by many players to be an effective way to fix the crashing issue.

To do so:

1. Open GTA 5**Settings** .
2. Click**Graphics** and scroll down. Find**VSync** and turn it**ON** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba3522a38573.jpg)  
 If it’s already**ON** , try turning it**OFF** , then restart your game and**turn VSync** **on** again.
3. Restart your PC and GTA 5 again to see if it works.
