## Try these fixes

1. [**Reconnect your HDMI cable**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Unmute your game in Volume Mixer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your audio driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Reconnect your HDMI cable

 You may have no sound on PUBG because your HDMI connection is not working properly. You should try reconnecting your HDMI cable and see if this works for you. To do so:

1. Disconnect your HDMI cable from your computer.
2. Connect your HDMI cable back to your computer.

 Hopefully, this fixes your PUBG sound issue. But if not, there are two more fixes you can try.

### Method 2: Unmute your game in Volume Mixer

 Your PUBG may be muted in Volume Mixer on your Windows system. You should unmute it in order to restore your game sound.

To check your Volume Mixer:

1. Right click**the volume icon** in the notification area of your taskbar, then select**Open Volume Mixer** .
