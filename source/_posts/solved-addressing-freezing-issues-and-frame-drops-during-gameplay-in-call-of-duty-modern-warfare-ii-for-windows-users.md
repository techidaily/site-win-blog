 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

### 3\. Update your driver

 The error code is related to the network connectivity which network driver involves.
