## 1\. Make sure that your computer meets the system requirements

 If your RoboCop: Rogue City crashes easily, you should make sure that your computer is above the minimum system requirements for the game. This is especially true for your graphics card: if your graphics card is rather old, there are bigger chances that RoboCop: Rogue City crashes on you, since older display cards usually have more trouble rendering game graphics.

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can refer to this post here for more detailed information: [**How to Check Your PC’s Specifications**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-check-pc-specs)

And here are the requirements for RoboCop: Rogue City for your reference:

 When you’re sure that your machine meets the system requirements, but RoboCop: Rogue City still crashes easily, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 2\. Update Windows

 If your system isn’t updated regularly, there could be compatibility issues that can cause RoboCop: Rogue City to crash. This is because RoboCop: Rogue City requires Shader Model 6.6 atomics and DirectX 12 for certain Windows operating systems. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Then try your RoboCop: Rogue City again to see if it still crashes. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 3\. Try to install RoboCop: Rogue City on your SSD

 Some gamers mentioned that installing RoboCop: Rogue City on their SSD instead of HDD managed to fix the game crashing problem for them. This is probably because SSD is more powerful and a lot faster when processing game files. So if your RoboCop: Rogue City freezes or crashes easily, please make sure that it’s installed on an SSD instead of an HDD.

To tell whether you have an SSD or an HDD, please view the Task Manager:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-11.png)
2. Click the second icon (**Performance** ), then check the **Type** field.

3. To make sure that you have the best gaming experience with RoboCop: Rogue City and are free from the pain of constant freezes and crashes, it’s highly recommended that you install the game on your SSD.

 If your RoboCop: Rogue City still freezes or crashes when you have it installed on the SSD, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your RoboCop: Rogue City’s crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help to fix the crashing issue with RoboCop: Rogue City, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on RoboCop: Rogue City and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.

## 6\. Make sure your computer is not overheating

 It’s also worth noting that a very common reason why games crash is that the computer is overheating, especially when the CPU and GPU are running hot. So if the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, or not strong enough for all your hardware components when resource-hungry programs like games are running, then there’ll be problems like sudden computer shut down and constant game crashes, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you run RoboCop: Rogue City, you need a cooler environment for your machine to make sure that the crashing problem doesn’t happen again.

 Here is a detailed post regarding how to check your PC temperature and what you can do to cool your computer down if it’s overheating: **[How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 7\. Repair damaged system files

**Repairing corrupted or damaged system files** could also help fix crashing problems with games like RoboCop: Rogue City. This is because the integrity of Windows system files is essential for the overall system’s proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause crashes, freezes, and problems that affect gaming performance.

 By repairing the core Windows system files, it may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to instability and crashes in RoboCop: Rogue City. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.
