6. Relaunch Discord and check if the camera is working fine or not.

### Fix 2: Rearrange your USB device (USB camera only)

 If your USB ports are overwhelming, your camera might not work properly. The USB port can handle the limited number of endpoints, if there are too many devices plugged in, it may lead to the error.

Here’s how…

1. Make sure all the USB ports are working fine.
2. Unplug all the external devices from the USB ports.
3. Reboot your computer.
4. Only plug your camera into the USB port and check the issue is solved or not.

If it doesn’t help, please move to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Close all the background app

 One common reason for the Discord camera not working issue is your camera it’s used in the background by other applications so it’s not available to Discord. Also, kill unnecessary background programs will give Discord more resources and prevent potential conflicts.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open**Task Manager** .
2. Choose the background app and then click**End task** to shut it down. Repeat the process until you’ve closed all the background apps.

3. Launch Discord camera to check.

### Fix 4: Update camera driver

 If your camera driver is not properly configured, outdated, or corrupt, it won’t work on your computer normally. In this situation, updating the driver may solve the problem.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-discord-camera-not-working/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download camera drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your camera drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
