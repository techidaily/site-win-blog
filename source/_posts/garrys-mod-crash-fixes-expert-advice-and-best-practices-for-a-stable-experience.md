3. **[Adjust the in-game settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Run Outriders as an administrator

 When Outriders fails to obtain the necessary permissions to function properly, it will crash. In this case, you should run the game in the administrator mode. This method also works for the_Outriders-win64-shipping.exe system error_ that many players reported.

Here are the steps:

1. Launch your Steam client and click the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/steam.jpg)
2. In the game list, right-click**Outriders** and click**Manage** \>**Browse local files** .

3. Right-click the**OUTRIDERS-Win64-Shipping.exe file** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/run-as-administrator-1.jpg)
4. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab. Then tick**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/run-as-administrator-outriders.jpg)

 Launch the OUTRIDERS-Win64-Shipping.exe file directly. If you’re asked to install components to run this program, follow the on-screen instructions to download the required files. Then see how Outriders works. If the crashes remain, the problem may be driver-related, and you can try the second method below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game crashes is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. If Outriders keeps crashing your PC, you should check if your graphics driver is up-to-date. If not, definitely update it now.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – GPU manufacturers will regularly optimize their graphics drivers for the latest titles. To get them, you need to go to the driver section of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**

 Find the correct driver that’s compatible with your system and download it manually. Upon completion, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro versio](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [n](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)

### Fix 3 – Adjust the in-game settings

 According to Square Enix support, Outriders crashing occurs mostly on the -60 class GPUs, and tweaking the in-game graphics settings would make it run more smoothly. You can try this setup and see how things go.

1. Run your Outriders and go to the**Game Menu** .
2. Select**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/in-game-settings-1.jpg)
3. Under the**Display** tab, set the parameters as follows:  
**Windows Mode** :_Borderless_ or_Windowed_  
**VSync** :_Off_  
**Enable FPS Limit** :_On_  
**FPS Limit** : Set the value to_between 30 and 60_

 While doing this may decrease the visual performance, it’s an effective workaround for Outriders inventory/menu crashes before the full version launches.

### Fix 4 – Enforce DX12

 Many players see a significant FPS boost when they run Outriders with DX12\. So we recommend you to force the DX12 mode to mitigate the crashing problem.

1. Open Steam and navigate to**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/steam.jpg)
2. Right-click**Outriders** in the left pane and select**Properties** .

3. Under**Launch Option** , type**\-force-dx12** in the text field.

4. Close the window and launch Outriders.

 Please note that DX12 is not fully supported in Outriders, which means it might cause other compatibility issues like stuttering.

### Fix 5 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Missing or damaged game files can also ruin your gaming experience. To scan and repair the faulty game files and cache quickly, you can use Steam’s built-in tool.

1. Run Steam and open the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/steam.jpg)
2. Right-click**Outriders** and select**Properties** .

3. Select**Local Files** from the left pane and click**Verify Integrity of game files** .

Once done, start Outriders and test the game.

 If all the steps above couldn’t stop Outriders from crashing,**reinstallation** is the last resort. The constant crashes can be triggered by the issues during your previous installation and a thorough reinstallation would just refresh the whole thing.
