 Below I have listed the minimum (for playable performance) and recommended (for enjoyable performance) requirements for PC, and later provided the steps to check your PC specs, so that you can see for yourself how your machine is equipped.

 If your PC fails to meet any one of the following requirements, or your hardware component is showing obvious signs of wear and tear, it’s time to upgrade.

### Fix 5: Verify game integrity on Steam

 Steam client has a handy feature that allows you to verify the integrity of the game – if any files on your PC are found different to the ones on Steam servers, they’ll be changed or repaired.

The steps are pretty easy:

2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to **LIBRARY** , then right click on Resident Evil Village game title and click **Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.png)
4. Click **LOCAL FILES** \> **Verify integrity of game files…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY.png)
5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Re-launch Resident Evil Village to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try **Fix 6** , below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Close background apps

 Having too many apps running in the background at the same time may also cause your game to crash. These apps compete for CPU, memory and even induce instability issues. So it makes sense that while you’re playing the game, you close these resources hungry applications and services.

Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** , then press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the**Startup** tab, then right-click on each item and click**Disable** .

3. Restart your computer.

 RE8 still crashes? Don’t worry – there’s a couple more fixes for you to try.

### Fix 7: Disable HDR in RE 8 and Windows

 Resident Evil Village supports High-Dynamic Range (HDR), which is a technology used to enhance contrast and colors in graphics rendering and bring about more life-like images. This may be the case, but according to some players, it could be the cause of the crash.

 So, it’s recommended that you turn off HDR mode (both in RE8 and in Windows if your monitor supports HDR) to see if it helps with the situation.

**How to turn off HDR in Resident Evil Village** :

1. Open Steam.
2. Go to**Library** , then right-click on**Resident Evil Village** and select**Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Resident-Evil-Village-steam-properties-1.png)
3. Click**Local** \>**Browse…** .
4. Open the**Config** file and set**HDRMode-false** .

**How to turn off HDR in Windows (if your monitor supports HDR)**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**desk.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/desk.cpl_.png)
2. Scroll to the Windows HD Color section and turn the toggle for**Play HDR games and apps** to**Of** .

 Once you have disabled HDR, run the game in the client and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to **Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Install the latest patch

 The game crash is likely to be a bug that comes along previous updates, which requires to be patched in the next release. To check if this is the case, you can install the latest patch, then run the game again to see if the crashing problem ceases.

 If there’s no new patch available, or the problem remains after installing the latest patch, head on to **Fix 9** , below.

### Fix 9: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause of Resident Evil Village crashing on your PC is software conflict.

 To identify if this is the reason, you should perform a clean boot on Windows. A clean boot starts Windows with the essential programs, so that you will know if a background program is interfering with the game, or the problem lies elsewhere. If it is the former, you can repeat the steps by narrowing down to the rest half of startup items, until you isolate the offender.

Here are the steps to perform a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to bring up the Run box. Type or past **msconfig**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-1.jpg)
2. Click the **Services**  tab and tick the box for **Hide all Microsoft services** .
