## Are You Experiencing Connectivity Issues on Xbox Live? Find Server Updates Here

**Cannot sign in or play any games (not even offline games) on Xbox Live** ? This is both frustrating and confusing. You may be wondering if the error is on your end or is everybody else is suffering the outage. So, is**Xbox Live Down or not** ? Read on and youâ€™ll have your answerâ€¦

## Is Xbox Live Down?

 Here are 3 methods for you to determine if itâ€™s an Xbox Live down problem. Just work your way down until you find it out.

1. [**Check if your other devices are able to connect to the same network**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Check Xbox Server Status**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Look up the error messages or codes**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Check if your other devices are able to connect to the same network

 When you have a connection issue on Xbox Live, it is important to check **whether your Xbox One console or PC (if youâ€™re using Xbox app on your computer) is the only device with no Internet connection** .

 To do so, simply check other devices (your phone, tablet, TV set) to see if theyâ€™re online properly.

* **If these devices cannot connect to the Internet either** , then obviously the problem does not lie with your Xbox or PC. You can either do some basic troubleshooting on your modem by yourself (such as performing a reboot on your modem) or contact your ISP for assistance to fix the issues with your network.
* **If these devices can access the Internet properl** y, then you should move on to**Method 2** , below to narrow down the problem.

### Method 2: Check Xbox Server Status

 With home network issues ruled out, you might want to check if itâ€™s a service server outage or not. To do so, simple go to the official[**Xbox Live Status**](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) . From there, youâ€™ll see the status information of Xbox services, games, websites and apps.

* **A green check icon** indicates that the server is working properly. If you still have trouble connecting to Xbox One, you might have to jump to Method 3 to locate the culprit.
* **A red exclamation mark** means the server is currently down. You can also read the on-screen information to know more about the outage and the affected platforms. Often, there is a**Notify me** option you can choose to get instantly notified by an email when the service is back online again.

## Bonus tip: Xbox Live still not working on my PC?

 If youâ€™ve exhausted all the fixes lain out on Xbox Support, but the Xbox One not working issue is still not resolved, then itâ€™s time to check if itâ€™s a driver issue on your computer.
