## 3\. Verify and repair the game files

 Corrupted game files would lead to game crashing issues. If it’s the case, follow the steps below to verify the game files in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **Library** .
2. **Right-click** on **Aliens: Fireteam Elite** and select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
3. Click **LOCAL FILES** on the left, then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . It may take some time to finish verifying the game files. If Steam finds anything wrong with the game files, it will re-download them from official server.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 When the verifying process is completed, launch Aliens: Fireteam Elite and check if this fix works. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Aliens: Fireteam Elite releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by the Steam client, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Aliens: Fireteam Elite again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Disable steam overlay

 Overlays are handy, but sometimes they may interfere with the game. Some PC gamers report that it seems that the Steam Overlay doesn’t pair well with the game.

 You can try disabling Steam Overlay for Aliens: Fireteam Elite and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Aliens: Fireteam Elite_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Nvidia GeForce Experience, Discord, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch_Aliens: Fireteam Elite_ and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Disable real-time protection from your antivirus software

 The real-time protection feature in some 3rd party antivirus software would block the game files, and this may lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application, and turn off the real-time protection feature. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Run Aliens: Fireteam Elite and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.

## 7\. Run the System File Checker

 You also need to check the system file if the game still crashes, because the corrupted system files would also crash the game.

 You can run the System File Checker to check and repair the system files. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the **Run** dialog. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl** , **Shift** , and **Enter** at the same time to open **Command Prompt** as administrator.
2. Type in the command below and press Enter to execute the command. The process will take some time.  
**`sfc /scannow`**

3. Close the Command Prompt window after the process is complete.

 Launch the game and see if it crashes. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next one, below.

## 8\. Stop overclocking

 Some players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.
