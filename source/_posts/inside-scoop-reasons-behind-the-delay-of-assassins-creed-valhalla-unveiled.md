## 2 – Reboot your network

 First, make sure you’re using an Ethernet connection to get a stable network all the time. Then you can try restarting the network. This will help fix Internet connection problems, improve slow-moving connections.

 Since your modem is on all day, it might cause the packets you’re sending and receiving to become corrupt, thus lowering your speed. Therefore, it’s a good idea to unplug your modem on a monthly basis.

 1) Turn off everything that’s connected to the network (your computer, tablet, printer).

 2) Unplug the power cord from the back of the modem and router. Make sure all the lights on the modem/router are turned off (please don’t push the reset button).

3) Wait 1 minute, then plug the power cord back into the modem/router.

4) Wait for the Internet light to turn green.

 Now you can reconnect the Internet and launch Assassin’s Creed Valhalla again to test the issue. If the game is still lagging a lot, check the next fix below.

## 3 – Update the device drivers

 Assassin’s Creed Valhalla lagging can be caused by an outdated or corrupt network driver. According to some players, they get a smoother game after updating their network driver. So make sure you always have the latest network driver.

 To get a flawless gaming experience, it’s also important to update your graphics driver. Because your video card is the component responsible for processing visuals and sending them to your screen, any game crashing issues are typically rooted in your GPU.

There are two ways for you to update the device drivers:

**Option 1 – Manually –** To update your network driver, visit your motherboard manufacturer’s official website and search for your model. You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Note that you need to find the drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically (recommended) –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead,**do it automatically** with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network card or graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now.jpg)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full suppor** t and a**30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Play the game to check if Assassin’s Creed Valhalla lagging issue still persists with your new network driver. If the driver update doesn’t do the trick, you can go ahead with the next fix.

## 4 – Disable VRR and V-Sync/FreeSync

 Many players may turn on VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) or V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization) to reduce screen tearing. But this can introduce input lag. However, if you have terrible screen tearing when playing Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, you can skip this fix.

1) Right-click the desktop, and select Display settings.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Display-1.jpg)

 2) Scroll down and select**Graphics settings** (in the**Multiple displays** section).

 Note: If you’re using a gaming console, you can turn off VRR by going to**Settings** \>**Display & sound** \>**Video output** \>**Video modes** \> uncheck the**Allow** **Variable Refresh Rates** box.

 4) Open the**NVIDIA control panel** .

 5) Click **Manage 3D settings** from the left pane.

 6) Under**Program Settings** , add your**Assassin’s Creed Valhalla** .
