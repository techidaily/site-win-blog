### Fix 1: Check your headset software

 If your headset has a supporting software, you need to check it first. In case it was muted there. Take the Razer headset for example. You need to go into Razer Synapse to check, if it was muted in the software, you won’t get sound.

### Fix 2: Update your audio drivers

 It is very important to update your audio drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter Skyrim no sound issue. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-skyrim-no-sound-problem/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download audio drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your audio drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

### Fix 4: Install DirectX from the Skyrim

 DirectX is a program that supports tasks related to multimedia, game programming, and other applications. Now modern Windows operating system would include DirectX by default but if you’re using a previous operating system, you may need to download and install DirectX from Microsft to fix this issue.

**HOW** : Go to the[Microsoft official website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) to downloaded DirectX. Install it in the Skyrim directly.

Reboot your computer, it should be work.
