There’re things you can do before trying complicated fixes:

* Make sure you’ve closed unnecessary background programs

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

2. [Install Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Update graphic driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Run as administrator

 Run as administrator is a working fix for many players. It’s easy and quick, so I recommend this fix as your first solution.

1. Close the game completely.
2. Right-click on the shortcut and click **Properties** .

4. Relaunch the game.

If it’s not working, move to the next fix.

1. In the Search box, type in **check for updates** . Click **Check for updates**  from results.

### Fix 3: Update graphic driver

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve the gaming performance and experience.

 If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the optimal gaming experience, and sometimes you may run into the crash or black screen issue.

 Update your graphics driver would help you. There are two ways to update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.
