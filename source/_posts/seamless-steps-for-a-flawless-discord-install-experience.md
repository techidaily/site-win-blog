### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver is vital to the game performance. So, to prevent Jurassic World Evolution from crashing and avoid other potential issues, you should keep your graphics driver up to date.

There are two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Manually** – You can download the most recent correct graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website, such as[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ,[**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[**Intel**](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) . Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 2 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game files can cause Jurassic World Evolution to crash, so it’s necessary to validate the game files for troubleshooting. We’ll show you how to do this both on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Steam

1. Launch Steam and navigate to the**Library** tab.

2. Right-click**Jurassic World Evolution** from the game list and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-2-1.jpg)
3. Go to the**Local Files** tab and click**Verify Integrity of Game Files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-verify-game-files.jpg)
4. Wait until the process finishes and re-open the game to test.

 Does Jurassic World Evolution return to normal now? If the crashing issue persists, check out[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) below.

#### On Epic Games Launcher

1. Run the Epic Games Launcher and select the**Library** tab from the left pane.

### Fix 3 – Remove conflicting applications

 According to other players, some audio applications like**Nahimic Sonic Studio** or**Sonic Radar** will interfere with Jurassic World Evolution and result in the crashing problem. If you have also installed these two programs on your computer, try uninstalling them and see if that helps.

 If you’re still unable to play the game, continue to the next fix then.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4 – Disable overlays

 The overlay feature supported by third-party software is also a known culprit for the crashing of many games. Follow the instruction below and make sure overlay is disabled on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Disable Steam overlay

1. Run the Steam client.
2. Click**Steam** at the top left corner and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/disable-steam-overlay-1-1.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**In-Game** tab. Then, untick**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/disable-steam-overlay-2.jpg)

#### Disable Discord overlay

1. Open Discord and click the**cogwheel icon** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-1.jpg)
2. Select**Overlay** and**toggle off Enable in-game overlay** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0-00.jpg)

 Check whether Jurassic World Evolution stops crashing or not. If this method doesn’t give any luck, proceed to the last one.

### Fix 5 – Adjust the graphics settings

 If you’re running Jurassic World Evolution on a low-end PC, it’s suggested you lower the graphics settings for a smoother performance. Here is how:

1. Launch the game and select**Settings** on the main screen.
