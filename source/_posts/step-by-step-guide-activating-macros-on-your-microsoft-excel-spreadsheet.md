 Using Microsoft Excel macros, you can run a prerecorded set of steps to automate many of your repetitive tasks. You'll have to turn on the feature before you can use it. We'll show you how to activate macros on a per-spreadsheet basis as well as for all spreadsheets in Excel.

##  Be Smart When Enabling Macros

[Enabling macros is not always safe](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/where-to-download-your-own-personalized-tyrion-lannister-ringtone/) and you should only use them when you're sure of the source of your spreadsheets. Good macros save you time by automating your tasks, but there are bad macros that can harm your machine.

 For example, if you've got your spreadsheet from an unknown source, you shouldn't trust it to run any macros as you aren't sure what it will end up doing. However, if you know the sender and you trust them, then it should be okay to allow your spreadsheets to execute macros.

##  How to Turn On Macros for a Specific Excel Spreadsheet

 To enable macros in a specific spreadsheet and not all spreadsheets, then first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 When your macro-enabled spreadsheet opens, [Excel will display a message](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/decode-youtube-shorts-a-complete-breakdown-for-2024/) at the top of the spreadsheet content. To allow this file to run macros, then next to the message, click "Enable Content."

![Select "Enable Content" at the top.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-enable-macro-one-spreadsheet.png) 

 Excel will allow the current file to execute its macros, and you're all set.
