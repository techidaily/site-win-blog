## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, the broken or outdated graphics driver is the main culprit behind the Premiere Pro crashing issues.

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, or if the graphics driver file is broken or corrupted, you may suffer from the program crashing, stuttering, and even screen flickering issues.

 Graphics card manufacturers like_Nvidia_ ,_AMD_ and_Intel_ keeps updating their graphics drivers. By doing that, they’ll fix bugs in the last version of graphics driver and enhance the graphics card performance. Sometimes, they also provides support for the new features in creative applications. For example:

> _The March NVIDIA Studio Driver provides optimal support for the latest AI-powered features in creative applications including Adobe Camera Raw,**Adobe Premiere Pro** , and DaVinci Resolve 17._

 In other words, the latest graphics driver will unlock the full potential of your graphics card and give you a better experience for creating and gaming.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Your graphics card manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them , you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**Or**

### Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)

## Fix 2: Reset your preferences

2. Click**OK** to confirm.

 See if the Premiere Pro crashing issue persists. If this fix doesn’t stop the crashing, don’t worry. Try the next fix, below.

## Fix 3: Turn off GPU acceleration

 GPU acceleration is one of the common causes of Premiere Pro crashing. If you’ve turned on GPU acceleration, temporarily disable it to see if you can fix Premiere Pro crashing. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Premiere Pro and go to**File** \>**Project Settings** \>**General** .  
![Turn off GPU acceleration in Premiere Pro](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Turn-off-GPU-acceleration-in-Premiere-Pro.jpg)
2. In the**Video Rendering and Playback** part, set**Renderer** option to**Mercury Playback Engine Software Only** . Click**OK** to save the change.

![set Premiere Pro Renderer option to Mercury Playback Engine Software Only](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/set-Premiere-Pro-Renderer-option-to-Mercury-Playback-Engine-Software-Only.jpg)

 See if Premiere Pro crashes after you switched GPU acceleration to Software Only. Usually, Premiere Pro may take more time to finish rendering after you disabled GPU acceleration, but it would reduce the frequency of random crashes.

## Fix 5: Close CPU / memory hogging applications

 Premiere Pro is a resource intensive application. If you’re running lots of applications at the same time in the background, your computer may run out of RAM and causes Premiere Pro to crash. If it’s the case, closing those CPU / memory hogging applications may get Premiere Pro work again, Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open**Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click**Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of**CPU** or**memory** , then click**End task** to close it.  
![Close CPU memory hogging applications](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Close-CPU-memory-hogging-applications.jpg)

 If Premiere Pro works well after you closed those CPU / memory hogging applications, congratulations!

 To prevent Premiere Pro from crashing due to insufficient memory in the future, you may need to consider upgrading the memory (RAM) on your computer.

## Fix 6: Check for overheating components

 Premiere Pro utilizes both CPU and GPU to perform heavy computations. If Premiere Pro runs on your computer for a long time, your computer may get overheated, especially when its cooling system is not working properly. Once your computer got overheated, Premiere Pro may crash without warning. If it’s the case, you need to cool your computer down.

To cool down your computer, you may need to

* **Clean the dust** from the fans and vents of your computer.
* Make sure your computer is in a**cool environment.**
* Use a**better cooling system** for your computer if yours is not powerful enough.

## Fix 7: Update / reinstall Premier Pro

 If none of the fixes works, try updating / reinstalling Premier Pro. Normally, after updating Premier Pro to the latest version, or reinstalling it, you’ll fix the crashing issue.

## Conclusion

 In most cases, keeping Premier Pro, Windows OS and drivers up to date would get rid of most program crashing issues. If these common fixes on this article didn’t help you fix the Premiere crashing issue, you can also try investigating Windows crash logs to analyze and troubleshoot the causes of the crash.
