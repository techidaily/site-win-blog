## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Low FPS, lagging gameplay, or poor graphics aren’t always caused by an old graphics card. Sometimes, updating your graphics driver can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make your game significantly run smoother. Moreover, updating your graphics can ensure that you always have the newest features. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now as it can make a big difference.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by heading to the manufacturer’s driver download page:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 As described above, updating drivers manually does require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

Here’s how to update drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

![update network adapter driver automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Scan-now-1.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them. )

## 5\. Disable fullscreen optimizations

If this didn’t make a difference, move on to the next fix.

## 6\. Customize graphics performance preference

## 7\. Disable background apps

 You may not know that many apps run in the background at all times – even the ones you never use! They use a portion of your system resources, making your machine run a little bit slower. And this may result in poorer programs performance. To get rid of this, you can attempt to disable background apps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Privacy** .  
  
![turn off background apps](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/privacy.jpg)

Now launch Days Gone and check it can help fix the low frame rate.

## 8\. Disable Windows 10 Game Mode

 Game Mode is a feature introduced to Windows 10 to make gaming a much better experience.

To prevent these from happening, you can follow the steps below to turn off Game Mode:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Gaming** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/gaming-1200x674.jpg)
