### Fix 6: Update your network driver

 If the network driver on your PC is missing or outdated, it may cause Fortnite login failed issue. **Try updating your network driver** to see if this issue persists.

 There are two ways to update your network driver:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Manually update your network driver** – You can update your network driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your network adapter.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with**your exact network adapter model** and**your version of Windows** .

**Or**

**Update your network driver automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Driver-Easy-Scan-screen.png)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.
