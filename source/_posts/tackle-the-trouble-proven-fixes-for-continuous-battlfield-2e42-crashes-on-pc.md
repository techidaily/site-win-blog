As one of the most awaited games in 2022, Elden Ring is finally here. However many players are not that happy with their gameplay. Various types of performance issues and technical bugs have been reported since the release. If you’re also experiencing**insufferable Elden Ring FPS drops and constant stuttering** , don’t worry. In this post, we’ve put together all the simple and quick fixes for you.

## Fixes to try

 Here are 6 proven fixes for Elden Ring FPS drops and stuttering. You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. [**Optimize graphics settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Verify integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Disable Steam overlay**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Adjust the NVIDIA settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 A broken or outdated graphics driver can trigger a variety of gaming issues such as constant stuttering or massive FPS drops. If you’re playing AAA titles like Elden Ring with high system requirements, you should definitely update your graphics driver to gain the best in-game experience.

To keep your graphics driver up-to-date, here are two options for you:

**Option 1 – Manually** : Major GPU manufacturers release new drivers regularly. You can go to their websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , find the latest driver corresponding with your operating system, and download it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After the driver update, relaunch the game to see how it works. If the problem persists, there are more fixes to try.

### Fix 2 – Optimize graphics settings

 If you’re using a laptop or multi-GPU system, make sure the dedicated GPU is properly utilized. If not, you’ll see huge FPS drops and it’s better to tweak the settings for maximum performance

1. In the Windows search box, type**graphics settings** and select**Graphics settings** from the result.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
2. Click**Desktop app** from the drop-down list and click**Browse** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dedicated-gpu-3.jpg)
3. Go to the game’s installation folder and add the**eldenring.exe file** .
4. Once it’s added, click it and select**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
5. Select**High performance** and click**Save** .

### Fix 3 – Verify integrity of game files

Restart the game and test. Still no luck? Continue to the next fix.

### Fix 5 – Disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator

 Some players also reported that disabling Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator resolves the stuttering dramatically. Disabling this device may stop some part of the device driver from installing, but your computer will work normally for the most part.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-1.jpg)
2. Double-click**Software devices** to open the category.

### Fix 6 – Adjust the NVIDIA settings

 If all the methods above don’t help and you’re using an NVIDIA graphics card, adjusting specific graphical settings may increase your FPS in Elden Ring.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-3-1.jpg)
