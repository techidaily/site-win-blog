### Fix 1: Make sure your PC specs meet the requirements

 Before you try anything more advanced, first check your PC specs. Immortals Fenyx Rising is a demanding game, both to your skills and PC hardware. A decent setup is a must if you expect a smooth gaming experience. If you find your specs don’t meet the game requirements below, then maybe it’s time for an upgrade.

 If your rig is powerful enough for the game, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Verify the integrity of game files

 The constant crashes could indicate**an integrity issue with your game files** . In that case, you can run some checking to repair the corrupt or missing files.

Here’s how:

1. Open your**Ubisoft Connect** client.
2. Under the**Installed** section, click the picture of Immortals Fenyx Rising.

3. From the left menu, select**Properties** . Under the**Local Files** section, click**Verify files** . Then wait for the checking to complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ifr-verify-2.jpg)

 Once completed, launch Immortals Fenyx Rising and see if it crashes again.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game crashes is that you’re using a**faulty or outdated graphics driver** .[According to some gamers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/k60g25/immortals%5Ffenyx%5Frising%5Fis%5Fvery%5Fpoorly%5Foptimized/) , updating the graphics driver can greatly improve the performance and stability of Immortals Fenyx Rising. So you should definitely**try updating your drivers** before attempting anything more complicated.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 This might require a certain level of computer knowledge. To update your graphics driver manually, first visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**

 Then search for your graphics card model. Be sure to download the latest correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your computer and see if Immortals Fenyx Rising crashes again.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 Microsoft releases software updates and security patches periodically to fix operating system issues. We always recommend**keeping your system up to date** , as doing so would help you avoid tons of strange errors.

And here’s how you can make sure your system is the latest:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) at the same time to open the Windows Settings app. Click **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** . Then wait for Windows to download and install available updates automatically.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’ve installed all the system updates, do a reboot and test the gameplay in Immortals Fenyx Rising.
