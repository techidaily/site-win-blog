### Fix 8: Add Ashen as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Ashen.

 Since Ashen consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and the game may not run as expected. You can try adding Ashen and the Epic Games Launcher as an exception to your third-party antivirus application.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 Hopefully, one of the fixes above has helped you resolve the Ashen crash issue. If you have any questions or suggestions, you’re more than welcome to leave a comment below. Thanks for reading!
