### Fix 1: Remove periphery devices

 This should be the first thing to do when problems occur. This is the easiest way to check whether external devices conflict with Windows Updating Process. By removing all periphery hardware components except for the mouse and keyboard, we’ll know whether it’s a hardware issue.

 If this does sort out the issue, try plugging back each device one by one. In this way, you can recognize which device causes the problem.

 If it’s not sorting out the issue, let’s head to the next fix.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
6. Reboot your PC and run Windows Update again. You should be able to finish the feature upgrade to 20H2.

### Fix 3: Disable antivirus

 The third-party antivirus software is installed to protect our PC from malware attacks, but sometimes they could be the culprit for PC errors.

 During the Windows updating process, the third-party antivirus could interfere and block the new files which can cause the Windows Update error code 0xc19001e1.

 Therefore, disable the antivirus software then restart your PC to apply the change. Update your Windows system and see if it fixes the issue.

Don’t forget to enable the software afterward.

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Use Windows troubleshooter

 The Windows update troubleshooter is a built-in app that comes up with Windows 10\. You can use it to detect what’s causing the error 0xc19001e1 and fix it automatically to get rid of the problem. And it’s easy and safe to use. Follow the steps below to run the troubleshooter.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + I** together on your keyboard. Then click**Update and Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Troubleshoot** tab on the left panel and click**Additional troubleshooter** .

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Repair system files

 One of the reasons that cause the Windows Update Error 0xc19001e1 is corrupted system files.

Here’s how to fix it:

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-error-0xc19001e1-in-windows-10/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**Start Repair** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.

#### Option 2 – Manually

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snap825.jpg)  
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.

4. Restart your computer to check the blue screen issue is fixed or not.

 If the result indicates there are broken files but SFC can’t fix them, you can turn to[Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for deeper examination and repair.

### Fix 6: Free up disk space

 When there’s no enough space on your disc for the installation of the update, you might receive error code 0xc19001e1\. So you need to ensure you have enough space. If you don’t have, deleting junk and duplicate files to free up some space.

1. Press**Windows logo key + I** together on your keyboard. Then click**System** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-on-System.jpg)
2. Click**Storage** on the left panel and you can view the storage usage of your computer.
