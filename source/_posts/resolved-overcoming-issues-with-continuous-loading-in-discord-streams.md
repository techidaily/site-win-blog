## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 simple solutions for you to troubleshoot the OBS not recording screen issue. You may not try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Turn off the preview window**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Run OBS as an administrator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Close unnecessary background programs**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Change the graphics settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Turn off the preview window

 According to many users, a simple workaround to OBS not recording screen is to disable the preview window. What you need to do is to launch OBS and untick the**Studio Mode** at the bottom right corner of the main screen. Then the preview window should be closed and you could check if the problem goes away. If the problem occurs while you’re recording a game, try to**minimize OBS** to the system tray.

 Turning off OBS preview should also mitigate the FPS drops while recording. But if this doesn’t help your case, have a look at the second method below.

### Fix 2 – Run OBS as an administrator

 If OBS doesn’t have proper administrator privileges, it will fail to record your screen as expected, but you could run it as an administrator to fix the issue.

1. Right-click the**OBS icon** on your desktop and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/run-as-administrator-1.jpg)
2. Select the**Compatibility** tab, tick**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now OBS should be working with full access and recording your screen properly. If not so, there are a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 3 – Close unnecessary background programs

 Software conflicts can also be a cause. To avoid this, you should shut down all unneeded programs running in the background before using OBS. Here are the steps:

1. Right-click any empty area of the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

2. Right-click a program you’d like to close and click **End task** .  
 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Once done, restart OBS to test. If the OBS not recording problem persists, continue to the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Change the graphics settings

 For users who are running OBS on a laptop or a multi-GPU system, using the wrong graphics card will trigger performance issues with the specific capture type. So OBS may not capture your screen. To fix this, you can select the dedicated graphics card manually via Windows settings.

1. Click the**Start** button and click**Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/change-graphics-settings-2.jpg)
5. Locate your**OBS executable file** , which is usually located at_C:\\Program Files\\obs-studio\\bin\\64bit\\obs64.exe_ , and add this file.
6. Click**OBS Studio** and click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/change-graphics-settings-3.jpg)
7. If you intend to use_Display Captur_ e, select**Power saving** and click**Save** . If you’re using_Window capture_ or_Game capture_ , select**High performance** and**Save** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/change-graphics-settings-4.jpg)

 See if OBS works without trouble. If you’re still unable to use screen capture, there might be something wrong with your device drivers. Check out Fix 5 to solve it.

### Fix 5 – Update your device drivers

 If none of the methods above resolves your problem, the cause can be driver-related. If your device drivers are missing, faulty or outdated, you may run into the OBS black screen issue and it won’t be able to record the screen properly. To update your device drivers, here are two ways for you:

**Option 1 – Manually** : You can update the drivers manually by going to the hardware or PC manufacturer’s website and then searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3.

Or you can click**Update** next to the flagged device driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
