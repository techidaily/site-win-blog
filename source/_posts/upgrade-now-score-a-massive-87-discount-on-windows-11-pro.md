## Upgrade Now: Score a Massive 87% Discount on Windows 11 Pro!

Whether you use your computer for work, play, or both, yet are still stuck on Windows 10, upgrading your operating system is an easy way to get more features and better security.

 We're talking about upgrading a current PC or a new build to [Microsoft's Windows 11 Pro](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/prime-methods-transforming-pin-videos-to-mp3-format-for-2024/) while it's available at a massive 87% discount. If your PC is compatible with Windows 11, the [Professional version](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-pathway-to-high-quality-images-on-deal/) has a lot to offer. From now until January 28th, [Windows 11 Pro is only $24.97](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/prime-methods-transforming-pin-videos-to-mp3-format-for-2024/) instead of its usual price of $199\. That's a substantial discount and saves you $174 on Microsoft's latest and greatest operating system.

 So, why would you want Windows 11 Pro over the standard Windows 11 Home Edition? Well, you'll get more features, additional security, and deeper controls over the OS. Security is essential, but all the extras are nice, too. The Pro version is ideal for business professionals and power users alike, where you can take advantage of remote desktop capabilities, Windows Sandbox, Hyper-V Manager access to run [virtual machines](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-realme-11-proplus-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), improved administrator tools like [Group Policy](https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-first-steps-in-the-youtubian-economy-building-a-brand-boosting-bank-balance/), and more.

 As the name suggests, [Windows 11 Pro](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/prime-methods-transforming-pin-videos-to-mp3-format-for-2024/) is designed for professionals, business users, or remote/hybrid workers, but anyone can benefit from the additional features. For example, [Windows Sandbox](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-secret-to-imovies-edge-cropping/) lets you run applications in a virtual environment safely separated from the rest of the system. This improves security and allows you greater control when opening files, managing programs, or doing daily tasks.

 Even if you aren't a heavy business user, upgrading to Windows 11 Pro gives you a slew of other goodies. It delivers full BitLocker device encryption beyond that of Windows 11 Home, a device locator for lost devices, firewall network protection, and more. You'll enjoy better snap layouts, redocking, and an upgraded Windows Studio experience with voice focus, auto-framing, and background blur for all those Zoom calls.

 Whether it's worth spending $200 to upgrade past Windows 10 depends on the user. Still, when you can get [Windows 11 Pro between now and January 28th for under $25](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/prime-methods-transforming-pin-videos-to-mp3-format-for-2024/), it's a no-brainer, even if you can't take advantage of every additional feature or security measure.

 As long as your computer is compatible or capable of running Windows 11 and you use the code within 30 days of purchase, you'll get to take advantage of everything Windows 11 Pro offers at a great price. Grab it while you still can.
