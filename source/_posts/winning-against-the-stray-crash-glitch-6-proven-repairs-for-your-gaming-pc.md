### Fix 1: Reinstall Minecraft

 Since many technical problems can be resolved by restarting, it never hurts to restart your computer and your game. Often this will be enough to fix your Minecraft not loading issue.

 And many players find it working by reinstalling the game. So you can uninstall Minecraft from your computer, then download and install the latest version of Minecraft to see if it works.

### Fix 2: Update your video card driver

 If your video driver is missing or outdated, Minecraft might not be loading, or Minecraft launcher may not work. So you should verify that your graphics card driver is up to date.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update drivers** – You can manually update your driver by downloading the latest version of your driver from manufacturer, and installing it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the graphics card and to automatically download the latest drivers (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install the drivers in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** the automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

Now re-launch Minecraft and see if it loads properly.

### Fix 3: Disable Mods for Minecraft

 Various mods are available for Minecraft and it’s normally to use mods when playing Minecraft. However, mods sometimes change your game’s behavior and may cause unknown problems.

 So if you use mods while playing Minecraft, try disabling mods, then re-launch Minecraft to see if that resolves your problem.

If your game works perfectly, you should find the culprit.

 If your issue still persists, don’t worry. There is something else to try.

### Fix 5: Disable Discord

 Discord facilitates the communication between each other when playing games

 If Discord overlay has been enabled for Minecraft, we recommend to turn off Discord. Then try to launch Minecraft and play. Or you can uninstall Discord from your computer and this will help troubleshoot your problem; then restart your computer to see if it resolves your problem.

 So there you have it – the five methods to fix Minecraft not loading. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave us a comment below.
