### 3\. Update your driver

 The error code is related to the network connectivity which network driver involves. If you have an outdated network adapter driver, you may encounter various network issues such as disconnect from an online game. This may not the fix for a specific problem, but it’s no harm to upgrade your driver to make your PC work efficiently.

 You can manually update your driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website or do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
