### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 You may encounter the Stellaris crashing issue when you are using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. When something goes wrong with your game, try updating your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-12_11-41-25.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**10)** After your computer restarts, relaunch your game to test your issue.

**If your game runs correctly** , that means one of the services or programs on your PC conflicts with your game.

 To narrow down the problematic service or program, repeat**steps 1-4** , then disabled the upper half of the services (the lower half of the services being enabled). Next, restart your PC to see if the game runs properly. If the issue reappears, then the problematic service is among the lower half of the services – you can then follow the same logic and focus on the lower half of the services until you isolate the one that causes the error.

 Once you’ve identified the problematic service, you can contact the game developer for assistance, or just run Stellaris with the service disabled.

**If your game still crashes after clean boot troubleshooting** , you should first **[reset your computer to start normally](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### If you’re on Windows 10…

**9)**  Restart your computer and check if this resolved your problem.

**If your game runs correctly** , that means one of the services or programs on your PC conflicts with your game.

 To narrow down the problematic service or program, repeat**steps 1-4** , then disabled the upper half of the services and enable the lower half. Next, restart your PC to see if the game runs properly. If the issue reappears, then the problematic service is among the lower half of the services – you can then follow the same logic and focus on the lower half of the services until you isolate the one that causes the error.

 Once you’ve identified the problematic service, you can contact the game developer for assistance, or just run Stellaris with the service disabled.

**If your game still crashes after clean boot troubleshooting** , you should first reset your computer to start normally. Follow the instructions below:

#### Reset your computer to start normally
