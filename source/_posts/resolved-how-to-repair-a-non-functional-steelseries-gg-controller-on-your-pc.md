## Install the latest game patch

 The developer of WRC 10 FIA World Rally Championship releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam or Epic Games Launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch WRC 10 again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Try adding both the game folder and Steam (or Epic Games Launcher if you play the game on the Epic platform ) as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable your 3rd party antivirus software before playing.

 Run WRC 10 and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

 If the game crashing issue persists, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.
