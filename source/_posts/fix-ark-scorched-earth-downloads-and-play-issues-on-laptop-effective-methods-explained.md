## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The developer of SnowRunner releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam or Epic Games Launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch SnowRunner again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Enable VSync

 VSync is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of a game with a monitor’s refresh rate. If your PC is suffering from screen tearing, enabling VSync can be an effective fix.

 Some PC gamers reported that by turning on VSync, the game stopped crashing. If you didn’t enable VSync, you should give it a shot.

 To turn on VSync in Nvidia graphics card, just open **Nvidia Control Panel** , then go to **Manage 3D Settings** \> **Program Settings** , then add **SnowRunner** . Scroll down to set **VSync** to **ON** . Then launch SnowRunner to enable VSync at in-game graphics settings.

 Launch the game and see if this fix works. If the game still crashes, just try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Close CPU / memory hogging applications

 Another common cause of SnowRunner crashes is insufficient memory. If there’re lots of applications running in the background at the same time, your computer may run out of RAM and the game may crash.

 If it’s the case, closing those CPU / memory hogging applications may get SnowRunner work again, Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Esc** at the same time to open **Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of **CPU** or **memory** , then click **End task** to close it.

![Close CPU / memory hogging applications](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Close-CPU-memory-hogging-applications.jpg)

 If SnowRunner works well after you closed those CPU / memory hogging applications, congratulations!

 To prevent SnowRunner from crashing due to insufficient memory in the future, you may need to consider upgrading the memory (RAM) on your computer.

## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 The clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to manually disable startups and services so that you can **find out the problematic program that crashes the game** . Once you locate the program, just uninstall it, and then the this issue will be solved. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.
