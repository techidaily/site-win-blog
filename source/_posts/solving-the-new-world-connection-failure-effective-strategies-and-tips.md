1. In the upper left corner of your screen, click**Steam > Change** **Account…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LOG-OUT-IN.png)
2. Click**LOGOUT** to continue.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LOG-OUT.png)

### Fix 2:**Verify Integrity of Game Files**

 You may run into this error if the files of the game you’re playing are faulty or corrupt. So you can verify the integrity of the game files (of the problematic game) to compare the files on your PC to the ones on Steam servers. If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s.png)

### Fix 8: Reinstall Steam

 If you’ve exhausted all possible fixes but the error still happens, you can reinstall Steam as a last resort.

**To back up the Steamapps folder:**

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Windows-logo-key.jpg) and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer, then copy and paste**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`** into the address bar and press**Enter** . This will open the installation directory of Steam.
