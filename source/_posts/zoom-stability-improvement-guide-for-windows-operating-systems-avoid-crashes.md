 Make sure your computer meets the requirements, then move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 The_Total War_ crashing is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If_Total War_ works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If your game still crashes, move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 3: **Run your game as an administrator**

 Steam sometimes can’t access certain game files on your computer under normal user mode, which could lead to the_Total War_ crashing issue. To see if that’s the cause of your issue, follow the instructions below:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-342.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-342.png)

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-352.png)

**3)** Click **Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-353.png)

**4)**  Restart_Total War_ from Steam.

 Now, check if this fixed the crashing issue. If your problem still exists, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game issues, such as crashing, freezing or lagging problem, is the outdated or corrupted graphics driver. So, when something goes wrong with _Total War,_ updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option.

There are two ways you can get the right driver for your graphics card:

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating drivers. To get the latest graphics driver, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Relaunch the game to see if your issue has been resolved. If not, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 5: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of_Total War_ release regular game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from running smoothly, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 To check if there is any update, go to the **[Total War: Three Kingdoms website](https://www.totalwar.com/blog/)**  and search for the latest patch. If a patch is available, install it, then run your game again to check whether your problem has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to Fix 6, below.

### Fix 6: Change the power option

 The power plan on all computers is set to Balanced by default. Under this mode, your computer sometimes might slow down automatically to save energy, which could be the reason why your game crashes frequently.

 To fix it, you only need to change your power plan to**High performance** . Here is how to do it:
