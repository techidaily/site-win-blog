 You may need to consult the**manual** of your motherboard to enter BIOS and change the SMT setting.  

 If you can’t find the SMT setting on your motherboard BIOS, you should try going to the**official support website** of your motherboard to get and install the**latest update for BIOS** . Then re-enter your BIOS and see if there is an SMT setting on it.
