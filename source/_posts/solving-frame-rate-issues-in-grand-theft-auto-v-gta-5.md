### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 A smooth and pleasant gaming performance also depends on your graphics card driver. If it’s incompatible, corrupt or out-of-date, you’ll run into various issues including Warcraft 3 crashing. To keep your graphics driver up-to-date, you should update it **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers will regularly roll out new drivers on their official websites:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**

 You need to find the driver that exactly corresponds with your Windows version and then download it. Upon completion, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ta-1-1.jpg)

### Fix 5 – Stop overclocking

 To gain the best performance, many players attempted to overclock their GPUs. However, doing this is sometimes counterproductive and can render your game unstable. We suggest**lowering your GPU to the default settings** to stop Warcraft 3 Reforged from crashing. If the situation isn’t mitigated with this workaround, turn to the next fix below.

---

### Fix 6 – Lower the graphics settings

 When your PC finds it difficult to handle the high graphics settings, the game will crash. In this case, you should lower the settings.

**1)** Launch Warcraft 3 Reforged.

**2)** Click the**menu icon** in the bottom right corner.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1-2.jpg)

**3)** Click**Options** .

**4)** Make sure**VSync** is turned off.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-3-3.jpg)

**5)** Set each of the parameters under Graphical Quality to**Low** or**Medium** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-4-1.jpg)
