## 1\. Update graphics drivers

**Graphics drivers** act as a bridge that allows your operating system and applications, such as Starfield, to interact effectively with your graphics hardware.

## 2\. Update Windows

 To ensure Starfield opens without interruptions, it’s crucial to keep your Windows updated. Windows updates often include bug fixes, make sure your system is compatible with application requirements, and enhance system stability, reducing conflicts that can hinder game launches.

To download and install the latest Windows updates, take these steps:

### On Windows 11

 Press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings. Then go to**Windows Update** and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the latest updates.

## 3\. Disable antivirus and firewall

 Your firewall and antivirus are diligent gatekeepers, which is great for overall security. However, they can occasionally misinterpret Starfield’s actions as threats. By turning them off briefly, you can check if they’re blocking the game’s launch.

 _Note: Only disable them temporarily for testing, and remember to re-enable them afterward. Otherwise, your system could be put at risk._

To temporarily disable the Windows Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.

## 4\. Verify the integrity of game files (Steam users)

1. Launch Steam.
2. Either right-click your game in your Library or click on the gear icon from the game’s Library page on the far right.
3. From the drop-down menu, select**Properties…** .
4. Select the**Install Files** tab and click on the**Verify integrity of game files** button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-to-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files-on-Starfield.png)
5. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes. When the process is complete, try to launch Starfield and see if it works.

## 6\. Uninstall and reinstall the game

 If none of the above methods work, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.

 After having the latest version of Starfield installed on your system, launch it and see if you can get into the gameplay.

 However, if you still have difficulty launching Starfield, try this last resort – run a full scan on your PC. Your issue may be**due to the corruption of your system files** .

 To make sure those files are intact, you can use the **System File Checker** (SFC), a utility in Windows that helps check any problematic files and repair them if there are any. Below is the simple step-by-step guide.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .
2. Click **Yes**  when you receive a prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following commands in Command Prompt, then press Enter.  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”

 When you see a message that says “Verification 100% complete”, type**exit** and press Enter.
