### Method 4: Copy the steamui.dll file from a friends’s PC

 If unfortunately, all the previous methods fails to help, you can copy the steamui.dll file from a PC that runs the same Windows system as yours.

**Part 1:**   Check your Windows system type and find a computer that runs the same system with yours.

Here’s how you can check Windows type of a computer:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**   to bring up the Search box.
2. Type **system information**   and then select **System Information**   from the result.

3. You should then see the system type of the computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Part 2:**  Copy the steamui.dll file from the working computer and then paste it to the problem computer.

Here’s how you can find the dll file:

1. On the keyboard of the working computer, press the **Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time to bring up the File Explorer.
2. Go to **C:WindowsSystem32** , then type **steamui.dll**  and press **Enter** . If it shows no results, go to **C:WindowsSysWOW64**  instead and search **steamui.dll** again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc561b04adb9.jpg)
3. Copy the steamui.dll file if found and paste it into the **same location**   as where you copy the file in your problem computer.

**Note:**   Keep in mid that not every computer with the same system type has the dll file you want to restore, so this method is not always successful either.
