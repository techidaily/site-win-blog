## Untangling the Problems in Call of Duty: WWII - Decoding Error 4128

Keep getting the error code 4128 in Call of Duty WW2? This is quite annoying and you’re certainly not the only one who faces it. Many players are reporting this issue. But the good news is that you can fix it. This article is going to show you how to fix the error code 4128 quickly and easily.

## Check server status

 When something went wrong with your game, the first thing you need to do is to check the[**server status for Call of Duty: WW2**](https://support.activision.com/onlineservices?gameTitle=Call+of+Duty%3A+WWII) .

 If the servers are showing as down, it could be for maintenance, or there could be a problem on the developers’ end. You can contact the game’s developers for assistance.

 If all the servers are showing as up, it’s likely something else is going on.

#### Fix 6: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game error code issues is an outdated or faulty graphics card driver. It’s essential that you have the latest correct driver at all times. There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

##### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your graphics product keeps updating the driver for your device. To get the latest correct one, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

##### **Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-201.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 One quick fix to game issues on PS4 is restarting your device. Here is how:

**1)** On the front panel of your PS4, press the **power**  button to turn it off.

#### Fix 4: Restore your PS4 settings to default

 Another method to fix the Call of Duty WW2 error code 4128 is restoring your PS4 to the default factory settings. Here is how:

**2)** After your PS4 is turned off completely**,** press and hold the **power**  button.

**3)**  After you hear **two beeps**  from your PS4**, release** the button.
