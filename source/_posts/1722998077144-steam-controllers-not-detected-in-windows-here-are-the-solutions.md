## Fix 2: Update your Steam client and games

 Before using the Remote Play feature, make sure your Steam client is updated. It can be a prerequisite to use the feature smoothly. Although most of the time, it will automatically download an update if there’s one available, you can always update it manually by selecting the**Steam** tab and click**Check for Steam Client Updates** .  
  
![check for Steam client updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-Steam-client.png)

 After you’ve updated your Steam client, also make sure that you have your game updated. An update would most possibly fix some known bugs, which can guarantee a better gaming experience.

---

## Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 A number of bugs can be fixed by performing a dirver update. If Remote Play isn’t working for you or you are getting poor performance, graphical glitches or black screens, make sure you have the latest drivers installed. driver updates can **give you a speed boost, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features** , all for free.

 There are two ways you can update your drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 To update your drivers manually, you can go to the Device Manager, then manually update each driver by following the on-screen instructions.

 Or you can go to the device manufacturer’s driver download page. Then find the correct driver for your system, download and install it step by step.

### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers** (recommended)

 Driver Easy will**automatically** recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

## Fix 4: Disable hardware encoding

 Hardware encoding is that it reduces the load on your CPU by using a purpose-built piece of hardware. It’s enabled by default to give you the maximum performance. But there is a possibility that it hinders your Remote Play from functioning properly. So you and your friends should disable it from the Steam client. To do this, follow the instructions below:

 1) Open your Steam client. Click**Steam** and select**Settings** .

![disable hardware encoding Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-hardware-encoding-Steam.jpg)

 2) In the left pane of the window, select**Remote Play** . Then click**ADVANCED CLIENT OPTIONS** .

![disable hardware encoding Steam Steam Remote Play not working](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-hardware-encoding-Steam-Remote-Play.jpg)

 3) Uncheck the option**Enable hardware decoding** and then click**OK** .

![disable hardware decoding Steam Remote Play not working](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-hardware-encoding-Steam-Remote-Play-not-working.jpg)

Now try reconnecting your device to check if the issue persists.

## Fix 5: Disable IPv6

 IPv 6, Internet Protocol version 6, is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP). But it isn’t necessarily more secure than IPv4\. While many users have IPv4 and IPv6 running and allowing traffic on both types of network addresses, some applications might not be able to adapt to IPv6\. And this would cause some connection issues and can be the cause of Steam Remote Play not working. So to fix it, you need to disable IPv6.

Then select**Open Network & Internet settings** .

![disable IPv6 right-click on the active network adapter](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/right-click-on-active-network-adapter-and-select-Properties.jpg)

 4) In the**Properties** window, scroll down until you see**Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP /IPv6)** . Uncheck the **Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)** checkbox and click on **OK** to save the changes.

![uncheck the checkbox Internet Protocol Version 6](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/uncheck-the-checkbox-Internet-Protocol-Version-6.jpg)

5) Now restart your computer for the settings to take effect.

## Fix 6: Use a static IP address

 Most devices use _dynamic_ IP addresses, which are assigned by the network when they connect and change over time. While when a device is assigned a _static_ IP address, the address does not change. Despite the fact that most users don’t need static IP addresses, some remote access solutions only trust certain IPs for security purposes. So if you can’t use the Steam Remote Play feature, using a static IP address might be working.

To set a static IP address, you can:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**ncpa.cpl** and press**Enter** .

![open network connections window to set a static ip address
](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/use-a-static-ip-address-open-network-connections-window.jpg)

 3) Right-click on your**active network adapter** , whether it’s Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Then select**Properties** .
