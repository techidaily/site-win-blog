### Fix 1: Remove periphery devices

 This should be the first thing to do when problems occur. This is the easiest way to check whether external devices conflict with Windows Updating Process. By removing all periphery hardware components except for the mouse and keyboard, we’ll know whether it’s a hardware issue.

 If this does sort out the issue, try plugging back each device one by one. In this way, you can recognize which device causes the problem.

 If it’s not sorting out the issue, let’s head to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Disable antivirus

 The third-party antivirus software is installed to protect our PC from malware attacks, but sometimes they could be the culprit for PC errors.

 During the Windows updating process, the third-party antivirus could interfere and block the new files which can cause the Windows Update error code 0xc19001e1.

 Therefore, disable the antivirus software then restart your PC to apply the change. Update your Windows system and see if it fixes the issue.

Don’t forget to enable the software afterward.

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

### Fix 7: Reset or reinstall Windows

 If all else fails, you may have to[reset Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , or maybe even[reinstall it](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) together.
