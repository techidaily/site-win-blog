### Fix 2:**Verify Integrity of Game Files**

 You may run into this error if the files of the game you’re playing are faulty or corrupt.

If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-1.png)

5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Once finished, launch the game to see if it can be played properly. If yes, congrats! If it’s still no joy, please continue with**Fix 3** . below.

### Fix 3: Set the faulty game in compatability mode

 Your current version of the game in question may be released prior to your version of Windows, which may cause the fatal error. If this is the case, you can run the game in compatibility mode.

1. Open Steam Client.

6. Launch the game in Steam Client and check if the Steam Fatal Error: Failed to Connect with Local Steam Client Process error is resolved. If it lingers on, please try**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Update your device drivers

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong or outdated device drivers. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes your problem.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Launch the game in Steam again to see if the issue is resolved. If yes, then great. If the error still pops up, please try**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5:**Run Steam as administrator**

 The fatal error may be related to issues with game installations or with Steam updates. So you can grant Steam administrator privileges so that it can run in the most optimized way. Once you’ve done that, check if the error still occurs.

Here is how to run Steam as administrator:

1. In your desktop, right-click on**your Steam shortcut** and click**Properties** .
