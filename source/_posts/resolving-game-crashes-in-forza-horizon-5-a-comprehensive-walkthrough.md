## Fixes for Forza Horizon 5 Stuck on Loading Screen

1. [Check your internet connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Repair common disk issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Run in clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Reinstall the Forza 5](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [Update Windows to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Before you set out to try the fixes below, please check on the **game server status**  first. Because if the Forza Horizon 5 is in the middle of server maintenance, you won’t be able to load into the game. For your Forza Horizon 5 server maintenance information, head to[**Forza Support Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/forza%5Fsupport) .

## Fix 1 Check your internet connection

 The Discord streams not loading issue could simply be a connection problem. Having a quick and simple check on your network connection should be your first fix to try.

1. **Reboot your network** . Simply unplug your modem and router from their power supply. Wait for a minute to let them cool off and then plug them back to their power supply. This can help with better network connectivity by refreshing the RAM and renewing the IP address.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/router.png) (a router)
2. **Try using a LAN cable** instead if you’re using **Wi-Fi**  connection**.**  Convenient as it is, yet most of the time **Wi-Fi**  is not stable enough for computer games. A wired connection would be a better option for your network stability.

 If network connection is not where the problem is, try the next method below.

## Fix 2 Update your graphics driver

 Outdated or corrupt drivers are the common reason for game crashing. Most game crashing errors can be fixed by **updating your graphics driver** . What’s more, the latest driver can improve your gaming experience. You can head to graphics manufacturers’ websites (like **[Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)**  or **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)** ) to download the latest drivers. However, if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/de-scan-now-11.jpg)

## Fix 4 Use a VPN

Here’s how to use it:

1. [Download and install **NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Run NordVPN, then choose a location you want to connect to.

To do so, you can:

1. Press the **Windows logo key**  and **R**  together on your keyboard to open the Run box.
2. Type **msconfig**  and click **OK** .

## Fix 6 Reinstall the Forza 5

 Corrupted or missing game files could be another reason that causes the Forza 5 to stuck. Reinstalling it can resolve stuck issues by overwriting those game files with a fresh copy. Going through the full install process again ensures all necessary game data, updates, and patches are properly integrated.

 Simply right click the Forza 5 on Steam, choose to**Delete Local Content** , and then**Download** it again will do the trick.

## Fix 7 Update Windows to the latest version

 Updating Windows to the latest version can resolve stuck issues by patching bugs, improving stability, and enhancing compatibility.

To check for Windows updates, follow the steps below:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke**Windows Settings app** . Select**Update & Security** .
