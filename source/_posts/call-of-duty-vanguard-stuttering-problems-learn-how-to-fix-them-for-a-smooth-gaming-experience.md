| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Processor | AMD Ryzen™ 3 1300X; Intel® Core™ i5-6400     |
| Memory    | 8 GB Ram                                     |
| Graphics  | AMD Radeon R9 270X or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 |
| Storage   | 42 GB available space                        |

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Edit username](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Run as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Disable your antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Edit username

### Fix 4: Update your drivers

 One of the most common causes of games crashing is you’re using outdated or corrupted drivers. You need to make sure your drivers are fully up-to-date so that you’re able to enjoy one of the best AAA titles in 2021.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)
