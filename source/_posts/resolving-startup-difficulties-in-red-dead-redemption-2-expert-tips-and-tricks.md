### Fix 3: Update your graphics drivers

 Rockstar Games says the most common cause of**Red Dead Redemption 2** not loading problem is outdated graphics drivers. NVIDIA and AMD work closely with game developers to keep releasing new drivers to boost performance and fix bugs.

 To improve your gaming experience, you should always update your graphics drivers to the latest version.

**Note:** You may as well try**updating Windows** to the latest version. In addition, make sure to update your game launcher and Red Redemption 2.

There are two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

#### Option 1 – Manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, you need to visit the manufacturer’s official website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download the exact driver for your device and install it manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **All the drivers in Driver Easy come straight from the manufacturer. They’re all authorized and secure.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![click scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/scan-now-3.png)

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** .)

![update all drivers with driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/update-all-your-drivers-1.jpg)

Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Launch the game again to see if**Red Dead Redemption 2** continues to get stuck on the loading screen.

---

### Fix 4: Delete Settings

 Many users find it works by deleting the configuration file. This will reset your game settings and let your**Red Dead Redemption 2** start again.

 1) Go to **Documents> Rockstar Games> Red Dead Redemption 2> Settings** and delete the setting file:**system.xml** .

**Tips:** There’s a lot of issues with Vulkan and DX12, you can try both and see what works better for you. Vulcan works better for me and my game runs flawlessly.

2) Launch your game again to test the issue.

 If**Red Dead Redemption 2** works like a charm, then congrats! If the loading issue still persists, you can try to delete your local Rockstar Games Launcher profile details.

 3) Open your Rockstar Games Launcher, go to**SETTINGS** \>**Account information** \>**DELETE** local profile.

1) Go to your game settings and turn off Vsync.

2) Launch your Red Dead Redemption 2 again to see if it is loading normally.

3) If the infinite loading issues still persist, then go to**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

* Open the System Configuration again.
* Enable services and applications that you’ve disabled one by one until you find the problematic one.
* After enabling each startup application, you need to restart your computer again to find the conflicting one.

 Once you find out the problematic software, you may need to uninstall it to avoid running into the same issue in the future.

### Fix 9: Repair your system files

 It’s very likely that some system files are corrupt or missing, and your game is sharing the same files, thus causing your Red Dead Redemption to get stuck on the loading screen. To restore these files, here’s how:

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FORTECTLOG.png)

**Fortect** Windows Repair is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way. It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues (powered by Avira Antivirus), and finally it detects programs that crash, missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

 Fortect is a trusted repair tool and it will do no harm to your PC. The best part is that you won’t need to worry about losing any programs and your personal data.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan. This might take 3\~5 minutes to fully analyze your PC. Once complete, you will be able to review the detailed scan report.

 3) You’ll see the summary of detected issues on your PC. Click **Start Repair** and all the issues will be fixed automatically. (You’ll need to purchase the full version which comes with full technical support. )

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

#### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your personal data.

##### Step 1\. Scan**corrupt files with System File Checker**

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt, type the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Check will begin to scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now.jpg)

 4) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what message you receive, you can try running**dism.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to further scan the health of your PC.

##### Step 2.**Run dism.exe**

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you may get some error messages.

* If restore heath gave you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 If the System File Check finds any files corrupted, follow the on-screen instructions to repair them, and then restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.

 Hopefully, one of the fixes above solved your Red Dead Redemption problems. Please feel free to leave us a comment if you have any questions or suggestions.

 If none of the methods solved your Red Redemption 2 not loading, the last solution is to update the Bios. Many players finally managed to start the game after updating the Bios, but still, it has varying success.
