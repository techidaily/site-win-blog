## Fix 1: Verify your game files

 If your game files are corrupt or have gone missing, it could cause Arise to crash. A quick way to fix it is to verify the integrity of your game files on Steam. Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam library and find Tales of Arise. Right-click the game and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Steam-right-click-Properties.jpg)
2. Under the**Local Files** tab, click**Verify integrity of game files** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/verify-game-files.jpg)
3. Steam will scan your local game files and do a repair if it detects anything wrong. It could take a while depending on the game size.
4. Once the scan is complete, restart the game.

 If verifying your game files doesn’t solve the problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Install the latest Windows updates

 When your system isn’t up-to-date, it can be incompatible with your game and cause the game to crash. Installing the available Windows updates may solve the crashing issue for you, and should also prevent other game errors caused by compatibility issues. Here’s how:

1. In the search bar on your taskbar, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for any available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.

3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation.

4. Restart your PC to let it take effect.

If Tale of Arise still crashes on your PC, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 If your graphics driver is faulty or outdated, it could cause your game to crash. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Windows doesn’t have the latest available version of the driver you need, you can also search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [INTEL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Asus](https://www.asus.com/support/Download-Center/)

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install the driver correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095369/26400" target="_top" id="2095369"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095369" border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="512"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095369/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new driver to take effect. If your graphics driver is up-to-date but Tales of Arise keeps crashing, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Turn off overlays

 Many programs, such as Twitch, have the overlay feature, which is quite handy and great for multitasking. But overlays could interfere with game performance and sometimes cause the games to crash.

 If you have overlays on while playing Tales of Arise, try disabling them. Here we’ll show how to turn off the Steam overlay as an example:

1. Run the Steam client and navigate to**Settings** \>>**In-games** .
2. Make sure **_Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_ is disabled** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-07_14-56-20.jpg)
3. Click OK to save the changes.

 On Steam, you can also turn off the overlay feature per game. If you only want to disable the overlay for Tales of Arise to test the issue, follow these steps:

1. Find Tales of Arise in your Steam library. Right-click it then select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Steam-right-click-Properties.jpg)
2. Under the**General** tab, **uncheck the box of_Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-07_14-59-03-1.jpg)
3. Restart the game to test the issue.

## Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 A clean boot will start your PC with the minimum sets of drivers and services that Windows requires to run.

 By doing a clean boot, you can identify if any background program was interfering with Tales of Arise and causing it to crash.

**Here’s how to perform a clean boot:**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, check**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-40-15.jpg)
3. Switch to the**Startup** tab, click**Open Task Manager** .

5. Restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If Arise still won’t start, jump to[fix 6](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) below.

 If Arise now starts, this means at least one of the programs you disabled was causing the problem.  
  
**Here’s how to find out which one(s):**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, tick the**Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox**,** then tick the checkboxes in front of**the first five items** in the list.  
 Then click**Apply** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-53-16.jpg)
3. Reboot your computer and launch the game. If it once again won’t launch, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If it_does_ launch, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BOutlook%2BRecovery"><img src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/outlook-recovery.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with Tales of Arise.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Switch to the**Startup** tab, and**enable the first five startup items** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-59-36.jpg)
3. Reboot and try launching the game.
4. Repeat until you find the startup item that’s conflicting with Tales of Arise.
5. Disable the problem program and reboot your PC.

 If you’ve tried a clean boot but Arise keeps crashing on your PC, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 6: Reinstall the game

 If your installation process was interrupted or an error happened during the process, the game could randomly crash. Reinstalling the whole game can be a hassle, but it’s definitely worth a try as it did fix the crashing issue for some players.
