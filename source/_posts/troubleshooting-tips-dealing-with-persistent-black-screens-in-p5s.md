## 1\. Verify integrity of game files

 When you have trouble launching your game properly, you need to check whether your game files are corrupted or missing. To do this, you can utilize the tool of verifying integrity of game files by following the steps below:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties…** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files Among Us](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/among-us-properties.png)

 2) Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click on the**Verify integrity of game files…** button. And Steam will begin to verify your game files.

 This will take several minutes. Simply wait for the process to complete. Once finished, click on the Play button and check if you can bypass the loading screen.

## 2\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is one of the core components of your computer. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU. If the driver is outdated or corrupted, you’re more likely to run into issues like it takes an extremely long time to load into the main menu screen. To pinpoint the root cause, you’re supposed to update your graphics driver.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience and computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a useful tool that automatically recognizes your system and finds the correct drivers for it.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

## 3\. Delete temp files

 As the name suggests, temporary files are the kind of files that store temporary data that is created by Windows itself or the programs that users use. They can take up a considerable amount of space and slow down your PC. This can also affect the responsiveness of your programs. To make sure you can run your system smoothly, you should delete those temporary files and it won’t cause any problems.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **%temp%** and then press Enter on your keyboard.  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files-1.jpg)

 3) Delete all the files in the **temp**  folder. (Press **Ctrl**  and **A** at the same time to select all the files. Then right-click and select **Delete** .)  
  
![delete temporary files ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/delete-temp-files.png)

 4) If a window pops up saying that **The action can’t be completed** , simply check the box **Do this for all current items** and click **Skip** .

 5) Now go to your **Recycling Bin**  from your desktop. Right-click on it and select **Empty Recycle Bin** .

## 4\. Disable firewall and antivirus software

 Windows firewall or antivirus software can help protect your computer from malware attacks. But sometimes they would block your game from launching or accessing the internet. Therefore, we would suggest you disable those antivirus software and Windows firewall temporarily before launching Among Us:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows + R keys** simultaneously to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and click **OK** .  
  
![disable windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/temporarily-disable-firewall.png)

 3) From the left menu, click **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .  
  
![disable windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/turn-windows-features-on-or-off.png)

           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"
           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">

	   <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png" style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain">
	</video>
	<div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982456%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>
</span>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982456/22993" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Select **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)**  for Domain network, Private Network and Public network. Then click **OK** .  
  
![disable windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-firewall.png)

 This may put you at greater risk for malware attacks. To be advised, don’t visit any unknown websites. If necessary, repeat the similar steps to turn on the firewall.

 Also, if you have any antivirus software installed on your system, make sure you click on the **up arrow icon** near the system tray, right-click on the program, and choose the option to disable or exit the program.

 Once you’ve finished all of these, play Among Us and you should be able to boot up the game.
