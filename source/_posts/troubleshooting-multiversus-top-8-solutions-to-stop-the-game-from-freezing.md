1. [**Run Genshin Impact as an administrator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install the latest DirectX and Visual C++ redistributable files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Perform a clean boot**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Repair the game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Run Genshin Impact as an administrator

 In some cases, you’ll need to run Genshin Impact as an administrator so that it can access the necessary permissions to work properly. Here’s how:

1. Go to the game’s installation folder. Right-click the**GenshinImpact.exe file** and select**Properties** .

 After you apply the settings, launch the Genshin Impact file directly from the folder and see if it opens correctly. If not, check out the second fix below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of Genshin Impact not launching is a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. GPU manufacturers will keep releasing driver updates along with new game patches. So if you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a while, definitely do it now to see if that fixes your issue.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

#### **Option 1 – Download the install the driver manually**

 You can visit the official websites of the graphics cards manufacturers ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), find the most recent driver that’s compatible with your operating system and then download it manually. This process will require some computer skills and patience.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

### Fix 3 – Install the latest DirectX and Visual C++ redistributable files

 If Genshin Impact doesn’t launch and you’re receiving specific errors like 0xc000007b or MSVCP140.dll cannot be found, installing the latest DirectX files and Visual C++ files might resolve your issue.

1. Go to the[DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) and click**Download** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/directx.jpg)
2. Open the downloaded file and follow the wizard to install DirectX runtime components.

3. Go to the[Visual C++ download page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) and download the latest Visual C++ redistributable package for your Windows.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/visual-c-page.jpg)
4. Once downloaded, run the exe.file and click**Repair** (or**Install** ) to initiate the setup.

 Now that you’ve installed the latest DirectX and Visual redistributable files, see if Genshin Impact works. If not, proceed to the next method.

### Fix 4 – Perform a clean boot

1. In the Windows search box, type**system configuration** and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1-4.jpg)
2. Select the**Services** tab. Then tick**Hide all Microsoft services** and click**Disable all** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-2-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-4.jpg)
5. Go back to the System Configuration window and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-3-1.jpg)
6. Click**Restart** when prompted.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-4.jpg)

 After the computer starts up, launch Genshin Impact to check if the issue persists. If it works without trouble,**enable the services one or a few like four or five at a time** . If the game works fine, there is no problem with these services. Then repeat the steps until you’ve checked all the services.

 If the services are not the culprits, **open Task Manager to enable the startup items (4 or 5 in a group)** to rule out the problematic applications. Some players reported that the Faceit app might interfere with Genshin Impact.

 If you find any services or applications that stop the game from launching, simply disable them before you play the game.

**IMPORTANT** : Once you’ve completed the troubleshooting process, you have to reset your computer to start normally. Follow the instruction below.

1. Type**system configuration** in the Windows search box and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-4.jpg)
2. Under the General tab, tick**Normal startup** and click**OK** .

3. Click**Restart** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-4.jpg)

### Fix 5 – Repair the game files

 If you’ve attempted all the fixes above but to avail, the problem might be related to corrupted or missing game files. It’s simple to have a thorough check of the game files if you’re able to get into the launcher, and this trick has worked for a few players stuck in the same situation.

1. Open the Genshin Impact launcher.
2. Click the**gear icon** at the top right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/repair-game-file-genshin-1.jpg)
