## 1\. Check system requirements

 If your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon crashes a lot, before or during the game, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon to run smoothly.

Here are the requirements for your reference:

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on your game and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.

## 3\. Run the game as admin and in compatibility mode

 Some gamers reported that running Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon as administrator (and preferably in compatibility mode as well) also helped to stop it from crashing. This is probably because giving the game administrator privileges ensures its full rights to do anything it needs on your computer. Lacking certain rights to use system files could be the reason why Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon crashes at some point.

 To check if that’s your case, you can try running it as an administrator:

1. Right-click your **Steam** icon and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-56.png)
2. Select the **Compatibility**  tab. Tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK**  to save the changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-57.png)
3. Then tick the box for **Run this program in compatibility mode for:**  then select **Windows 8** from the dropdown list.

 Now open Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon again (it should be opened with administrative permission), to see if it still crashes. If the problem still remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon’s crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help to fix it, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

## 5\. Turn off RTX (Ray Tracing)

 If your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon usually crashes in the middle of the game, it’s probably helpful if you can**turn off Ray Tracing** , which helps to produce realistic lighting effects, adding an extra level of realism to the game. But ray tracing also takes much processing power, which could cause problems like game crashing or freezing. To see if turning of ray tracing helps:

1. Launch Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon and go to settings. Then click SYSTEM.

5. Then play the game and see if the crashing stops.

If Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon still crashes, please move on.

## 6\. Make sure your graphics card and CPU are not running hot

 An overheated computer environment is also one of the most common reasons why your game crashes. If the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, your machine may run hot. In addition, games usually consume more computer resources than other programs, and therefore add more pressure to your computer’s cooling system. So if your computer is overheated, there’s a bigger chance that your Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon crashes easily, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you play games, you need a better cooling system for your machine to make sure that Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon doesn’t crash.

 Here is a detailed post with instructions on how you can cool your computer down if your computer is overheating: **[How](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
