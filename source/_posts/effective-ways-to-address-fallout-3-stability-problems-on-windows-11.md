## 1\. Make sure your machine meets the system requirements for House Flipper 2

 Technically speaking, House Flipper 2 doesn’t have rather high requirements for your computer, especially when compared to other games. So if your House Flipper 2 crashes easily, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for House Flipper 2 to run smoothly.

Here are the requirements for your reference:

| Minimum   | Recommended                                         |                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| OS        | Windows 10 64bit                                    | Windows 10 64bit or newer                      |
| Processor | AMD Ryzen 5 1st gen / Intel Core i5 7th gen         | AMD Ryzen 5 3rd gen / Intel Core i5 10th gen   |
| Memory    | 8 GB RAM                                            | 8 GB RAM                                       |

| DirectX   | Version 11                                          | Version 1                                      |
| Storage   | 6 GB of available space                             | 6 GB of available space                        |

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can press the**Windows** key and the**R** key on your computer at the same time, then type msinfo32 to check your system specs in detail:

 When you’re sure that your machine meets the system requirements to run the game, but House Flipper 2 still crashes, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 2\. Start House Flipper 2 with a command

 If your House Flipper 2 keeps crashing even from the very beginning, you can try the following command to see if it helps:

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows key and the R key at the same time to invoke a Run command.
2. Copy and paste this command and hit Enter:` **steam://rungameid/613100// -force-feature-level-10-0** `  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-82.png)
3. When asked if you want to run House Flipper 2, click OK to continue.

 This command is to force House Flipper 2 to run on Direct 10, which is lower than Direct 11 it requires. It should work on older computers or older graphics cards. But if your House Flipper 2 still crashes or doesn’t open in this way, please move on.

---

## 3\. Update Windows

 System updates from Windows usually help to stabilize and optimize the overall computer environment. So if your system isn’t updated regularly, there could be compatibility issues that can cause House Flipper 2 to crash easily. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png)

4. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll see**You’re up to date** like this.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png)

 Then try your House Flipper 2 again to see if it still crashes. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

---

## 4\. Disable OneDrive, DropBox, or antivirus program(s)

 This is another proven issue by the game developer: OneDrive, Dropbox or third-party antivirus programs could be the culprit to your House Flipper 2 crashing problem. This is because these services or programs might be blocking access to the game files, and thus cause the crashes.

 So to fix the crashing problem with House Flipper 2, you can exclude the **C:\\Users\\username\\OneDrive\\Documents\\House Flipper 2\\machine.conf** folder from OneDrive or Dropbox.

 Or you can exclude the entire folder of House Flipper 2 in Dropbox as instructed here:[https://help.dropbox.com/sync/ignored-files](https://help.dropbox.com/sync/ignored-files)

 If this method doesn’t work to fix the House Flipper 2 crashing on PC problem for you, please move on to the next one.

## 7\. Update display card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your House Flipper 2’s crashing launching problem, so if the above two methods don’t help to stop the crashes in House Flipper 2, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264" border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

## 8\. Turn off V-Sync

 VSync (Vertical Sync) is designed to fix screen tearing and screen stuttering by syncing the refresh rate with the frame rate of your monitor. When the game’s frame rate is too high for your monitor to keep up, not only will you notice the eye-soring screen tearing, but also the game crashing like the one with House Flipper 2\. To fix it, you can change the VSync settings for your display card.

* **[If you have an Nvidia display card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[If you have an AMD display card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### **To enable VSync in NVIDIA Control Panel:**

1. On your desktop, right-click in an empty space and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/right-click-nvidia.png)
2. In the left pane, select **Manage 3D Settings** and choose **Global Settings** . Then find **Vertical sync** and click the drop-down menu on the right. Select **On**  and click **Apply** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3d-settings.png)

 Setting Vertical sync to **Adaptive** might also be efficient, according to some players.

 NVIDIA and AMD settings will default to application settings. It means that they will respect in-game settings. If you select Always On for NVIDIA/AMD in-game, then VSYNC will remain On when appropriate.

 When V-sync is off, launch House Flipper 2 again to see if it still crashes. If the problem still remains, please move on.

## 9\. Reinstall the game into a different drive (preferably to an SSD)

 At this point, you should consider reinstalling House Flipper 2 if you haven’t already. And we’d suggest you install it on your SSD instead of the HDD this time. This is because SSD is much faster to process and manage system storage for the game, and can then eliminate the possibility of having House Flipper 2 crashing on PC.

To tell which drive you have, please view the Task Manager in this way:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-11.png)
2. Click the second icon (**Performance** ), then check the **Type** field.

 If you are facing persistent crashing with your House Flipper 2 and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones.
