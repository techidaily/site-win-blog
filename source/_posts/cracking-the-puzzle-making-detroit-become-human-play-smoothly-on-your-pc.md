3. Wait until the checking to finish.

You can then launch Detroit: Become Human and see if it crashes again.

 If this solution doesn’t work for you, please continue to the next one.

### Fix 3:**Close all** background**applications**

 Detroit: Become Human is a demanding game, and the crash can occur when you have some other large programs eating up your CPU resources and RAM. So if you’re running big programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** or**Windows Update** , be sure to close them before launching your game.

If this fix failed to solve your issue, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 More often than not, the crash of new games tends to be graphics-related. It usually indicates that you’re using**a** **faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Whether you’re using a 1,000 dollars gaming rig or just a five-year-old school laptop, always make sure you make the most out of it, with the latest graphics driver.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Then search for your exact GPU model. Remember to download the latest correct installer that’s compatible with your operating system. And always restart your PC after updating device drivers.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)
