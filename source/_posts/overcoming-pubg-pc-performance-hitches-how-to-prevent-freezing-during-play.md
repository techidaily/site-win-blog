## Optimizing for Victory: Overcoming Common Performance Drops and Stuttering in GTFO Games

![GTFO FPS drops on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GTFO-FPS-drops-on-PC.jpg "GTFO")

GTFO

 GTFO, an extrame cooperative horror shooter, is finally ready for release after two years of early access. On December 9 at the Game Awards, 10 Chambers revealed that GTFO 1.0 has arrived. As more and more PC gamers come back to play the game, many of them are bothered by**GTFO FPS drop issue on their PC** . If you find yourself on the same boat, don’t worry. You’ve come to the right place. After reading this article, you shloud be able to fix the GTFO performance issues and boost the GTFO in-game FPS easily!

## Try these fixes

 Here’s a list of fixes that have helped other PC gamers fix the GTFO FPS drop issues. You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way through the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. **[Install the latest game patch](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Set the Power Plan of your PC for high performance](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Modify graphics card settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Install the latest game patch

 10 Chambers, the developers of GTFO, releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run GTFO and see if the FPS is back to normal. If the in-game FPS still drops, or there are no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver, because the outdated or faulty graphics driver may trigger GTFO FPS dropping issue.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Set the power plan of your PC for high performance

 Windows power plans are designed to manage how your computer consumes and conserves power. You may encouter FPS drops when your computer is using the balanced or power saver plan.

 In most cases, the power plan on a PC is set to **Balanced** by default, which may limits the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 If you’re experiencing peformance issues like FPS dropping, try modifying the power plan on your PC for Best Performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .

![run dialog - powercfg.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![control panel power options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)

 Run GTFO and check if you get a better PFS. If the GTFO FPS drops again, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Modify graphics card settings

 Tweaking your graphics card settings in Nvidia or AMD control panel would also boost the in-game FPS. If you didn’t modify your graphics card settings, then you should give it a try.

**For Nvidia users** , follow the steps below:

1. **Right-click** on your desktop and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** from the context menu.
2. Click **Manage 3D Settings** on the left, then navigate to the **Program Settings** tab. In the **Select a program to customize:**  part, add **GTFO** from the program list.
3. In the **Specify the settings for this program** section, modify following settings:  
**Max Frame Rate** : Set it to a frame rate below your monitor’s current refresh rate.  
**Preferred refresh** **rate** : set it to “Highest available”  
**OpenGL rendering GPU** : Set it to your Nvidia GPU  
**Maximum pre-rendered frames** : set it to 1  
**Power Management** : “Prefer Maximum Performance”  
**Low Latency Mode** : “Ultra”  
**Vertical sync** : “Fast”  
**Texture filtering – Quality** : “Performance”
4. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

**For AMD users** , follow the steps below:

1. Open **AMD Radeon Settings** .
2. Go to **Gaming** **\>** **Global Settings** . Then modify the settings the same way you see on the screenshot below.  
![AMD Radeon Settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AMD-Radeon-Settings.jpg)

 Launch GTFO and see if the in-game FPS improves. If not, move on to the next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 Overlays are handy, but according to many PC gamers, they sometimes may interfere with GTFO and even introduces performance issues and compatibility issues. If the fixes above didn’t give you a obvious FPS boost, then try disabling overlays before playing the game.

 There’re many apps that provide overlay features. Here I’ll take the Steam Overlay as an example to show you how to turn the in-game overlay off in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **LIBRARY** , then right click on GTFO game title and click **Properties…** .

<a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453" border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. In the **GENERAL** section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Disable the Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-It-Takes-Two.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Run GTFO again after you disabled all the in-game overlays and see if the in-game FPS increases. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar

 Those who love sharing game highlight videos would love Xbox Game Bar and the background recording feature in Windows 10 and Windows 11\. However, once thesefeatures are enabled, they’ll constantly run in the background, hogging tons of resources.

 If you’ve enabled background recording and Xbox Game Bar, and you’re suffering from in-game FPS drops, try disabling them:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to open **Windows Settings** . Click **Gaming** to open Windows 10 gaming settings.  
![Windows 10 settings gaming](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Windows-10-settings-gaming.jpg)
2. **Turn off** the toggle under **Xbox Game Bar** if it is turned on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Turn off Xbox Game Bar](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-Xbox-Game-Bar.jpg)
3. Click **Captures** on the left, then **turn off** the toggle udner **Background recording** if it is turned on.
