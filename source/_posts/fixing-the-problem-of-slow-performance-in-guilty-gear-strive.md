## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

The outdated or broken graphics driver may also lag the game.

 As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping, or lagging) and even screen flickering issues. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date so as to avoid such issues. The latest graphics driver will enhance your graphics card performance and unlock the full potential of your graphics card, which will give you an edge in PC video games.

 If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.
