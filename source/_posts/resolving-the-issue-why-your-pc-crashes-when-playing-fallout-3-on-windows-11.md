## Official Fix

Follow the steps below to fix the crashing issue.

### Step 1: Check the requirements

 Make sure your PC has meet the minimum requirements of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life.

| **OS**        | Windows 10                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Intel Core i5-3470 \| AMD FX-6300                        |
| **Memory**    | 4 GB RAM                                                 |
| **Graphics**  | Nvidia GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB \| AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB |
| **DirectX**   | Version 11                                               |
| **Storage**   | 40 GB available space                                    |

### Step 2: Update your drivers

 Make sure your drivers are updated.

 You can update drivers one by one through the manufacturer’s official website manually, or update all drivers by[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) with 2 clicks.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it.
