 Not getting any sound from streams on Twitch? You’re not alone! Many Twitch users are reporting the audio missing issue. This problem can be frustrating, especially when all your other apps have sound.

 But don’t panic. You can fix it. In this post, we’ve put together 4 methods to resolve the Twitch audio issues.

## How to Fix Twitch No Sound Issues

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

* [**First Things to Check**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Method 1: Restart Your PC**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Method 2: Fix Browser Issues**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Method 3: Update Your Audio Driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Method 4: Run Windows Audio Troubleshooter**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## First Things to Check

 Several different factors can affect the sound on your computer: your audio driver, the installed hardware, Windows sound settings. But before you begin troubleshooting Twitch sound problems, follow the instructions below to rule out the obvious.

#### Check the cable connection

 If you have multiple audio devices (external speakers or a microphone) hooked up to your computer, check to see if your devices are**powered on** and**the wired connections clean and plugged in** all the way.

#### Ensure your computer is not on mute

 When you run into audio issues on your computer, another thing to do is to test the sound from ANY application. You can do this by opening local multimedia files, such as audio or video played in Windows Media Player, to see if you get sound from them. If you hear sound from other apps, skip to **[Method 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to fix your issue.

 If there’s no sound at all,**check** the speak icon on the bottom right corner of your screen to see**if you’ve accidentally muted the sound** .

 If the volume is on, follow the instructions below to check if you set the right playback device.

#### Set the right playback device

**1)** Right-click the **Volume Control icon** on the taskbar and select **Sounds** .

## Method 1: Restart Your PC

 Sometimes the audio missing problem is just a temporary error that you can fix by restarting your PC.

 A reboot wipes away the current state of the software. In case of losing data, please make sure you don’t have any unsaved documents open before restarting your device.

If your issue persists after the reboot, then go ahead with the next fix.

If not, read on and try the next solution.

#### Try an alternative browser

 You can try streaming on another browser. For example, if you were streaming on Chrome, try using another browser like Opera or Edge. If the problem is occurring in Chrome only, then it could be a Chrome issue. You can try updating your browser or contact the developer for assistance.

## Method 3: Update Your Audio Driver

 One of the most common causes of audio problems on Windows devices is an outdated or a faulty audio driver.

 So you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can get the right driver for your audio card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, such as **[NVidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/)**  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-02_17-04-51.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 If the sound issue isn’t resolved, then move on to the next fix below.

## Method 4: Run Windows Audio Troubleshooter

 The audio troubleshooter is a Windows **built-in utility** that can detect and fix common audio problems automatically.

 If you run into audio issues on your Windows devices, chances are the Audio Troubleshooter can help fix it.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and type **audio** troubleshooter. Then click **Find and fix audio playback problems** .
