## Trouble with Rogue Company on Your Computer? Here's How to Stop the Constant PC Crashes

[Rogue Company](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/rogue-company?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=933ada2ec45e4184ae840d64c99e0ba9) has been out for a while now, and there’re still many players complaining about a**constant crashing issue** with this new shooter. But don’t worry if you happen to be on the same boat — below we’ve gathered some working fixes for your crashing issue, try them and get back to your team right away.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that solves your problem.

1. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Disable in-game overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 In some cases, the not launching or crashing during game issue indicates that some game files are missing or corrupted. Before furthering your efforts into fixes that are more complicated, run a scan and check if there’re any integrity issues.

Follow these steps:

1. Open your**Epic Games** launcher. From the left pane, select**Library** . At the bottom right corner of the Rogue Company box, click the**ellipse** icon.

2. Select**Verify** . Then wait for the process to complete.

3. Once done, launch your game and check if the problem persists.

 If this fix doesn’t give you luck, take a look at the next one below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 More often than not, especially in new titles, the constant crashes are graphics-related. Aside from misconfigurations, one of the common causes is that you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . You should always keep your driver up to date and don’t wait until an issue occurs. New drivers can, sometimes, bring your game performance to a whole new level.

 There’re generally 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to update your GPU driver manually. To do so, first visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)

 Then search for your exact graphics card model. Be sure to download the latest correct installer according to your operating system. Once downloaded, open the wizard and follow the instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 After updating all your drivers, restart your PC for the changes to apply. Then check the gameplay in Rogue Company.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Windows 10 receives continuous support in the form of updates. These patches and feature updates address major compatibility issues and could be a potential fix to your crashing issue. Usually Windows will schedule updates for you, but you can make it happen manually:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

Once completed, restart your PC and check if Rogue Company crashes again.

 If updating your system doesn’t help, you can check out the next method.

### Fix 4: Disable in-game overlays

 Overlay allows you to chat, place orders and interact with friends on another platform during game. This feature is included in apps like**Steam, Discord and NVIDIA GeForce Experience** and is usually turned on by default.

 Normally it’s just a handy function, but there’re also reports that it may trigger performance issues and sometimes even game crashes. So if you’re using any programs mentioned above, try turning them off or disabling the in-game overlay inside them and see how it goes.
