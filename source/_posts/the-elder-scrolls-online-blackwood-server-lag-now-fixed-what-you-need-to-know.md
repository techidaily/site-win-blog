### Fix 1:**Use a controller instead**

 Given that we all have different PC setups, the reasons for the stuttering could be different. Some players discover a temporary fix to the stuttering issue, which is to**use a controller** instead of a set of keyboard and mouse. If available, you can try the same and see how it goes.

 If you don’t have a controller at hand, or it doesn’t work for your case, simply move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The stuttering and FPS issues could indicate that you’re using a**buggy or outdated graphics driver** . Developers of Deathloop stressed that players should use the latest GPU driver for the best performance. So if you don’t know whether you’re on the latest driver, definitely check it now.

> Dear friends about to play Deathloop on PC. Remember to update your GPU drivers. It's quite important!

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), downloading the latest correct installer and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience for that, you can update automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-2060-super-update.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and test the gameplay in Deathloop.

 If the latest drivers don’t seem to work for you, take a look at the next method.

### Fix 3: Check for system updates

 To make the most out of your hardware, it’s also important to keep your system up to date. Normally Windows updates automatically, but you can also check if you’re missing the latest feature update.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once you’ve updated your system, restart your PC and check the results in Deathloop.

 If this method doesn’t give you luck, simply check out the next one below.

### Fix 4: Change in-game graphics settings

 If your rig isn’t top of the line, you can tune the in-game settings a bit to work around the stuttering. Before the optimization patches come out, here’re some settings you can try:

1. Open Deathloop and go to**OPTIONS** .
2. In the left pane, select**Visuals** and set the following:  
   * **Low Latency** : On  
   * **V-Sync** : Off  
   * **AMD FSR Mode** : Ultra Quality  
   * **Upscaling** : AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/deathloop-graphics-settings-1.jpg)
3. Set**FPS Limiter** to**120** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/deathloop-graphics-settings-2.jpg)

Now you can start a game and test the performance.

 If these settings couldn’t help you, take a look at the next solution.

### Fix 5: Cap the framerate to 60

 There’re also players saying that they manage to stop the stuttering by capping the FPS. You can do the same and see if it works for you too. Instead of setting in-game FPS Limiter, you need to cap the framerate in the graphics card control panel.

Here’s how to do it with NVIDIA GPU:

1. At the empty area of your Desktop, right click and select NVIDIA control panel.

2. In the left pane, select**Manage 3D** settings. In the Global Settings section, turn on**Max Frame Rate** and set the value to**60** .

Now you can restart the game and check if the stuttering is gone.
