 Wait for the process to complete, and relaunch World of Warships to test this method. If it fails to cure the crash, move on to the fixes below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics card driver

 Graphics card is important in determining the video game performance. If your GPU driver is wrong or outdated, you might get a lot of crashes when playing World of Warships. To solve this, you need to get the right and latest graphics driver safely. Here’re two options for you: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Update the graphics card driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep updating drivers and they’re usually available on their official websites:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually. Then, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics card driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/de.jpg)
