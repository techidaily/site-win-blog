<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 Launch Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy after the verifying process is complete. See if it crashes again.

## 4\. Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.
