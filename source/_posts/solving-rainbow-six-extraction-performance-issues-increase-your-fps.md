### 2\. Stop overclocking

 The Intel “K” and “X” chips usually mean the chip is unlocked. Many gamers like squeezing out a little extra performance than what you get out of the box. When coupled with good ventilation and cooling, CPU overclocking can reap great results.

 But if you’re experiencing Rainbow Six Extraction crashing issues when tweaking the clock speeds, you should stop overclocking and try resetting your processor (and GPU, if appropriate) to default settings.

### 3\. Verify your game files

 This is a very basic troubleshooting step you should try before heading on to other fixes. Here’s how to do it in Ubisoft Connect PC:

 1) Launch Ubisoft Connect PC, and go to the**Game** tab.

 2) Select**Rainbow Six Extraction** , then select**Properties** on the left-hand side of the game overview.

 3) Under Local files choose **Verify files** .

 4) If prompted, select **Repair** .

 Ubisoft Connect PC will then download and restore any missing or corrupted files.

 See if this issue persists after you repaired the game files. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next fix, below.

### 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes can be blamed on   **the incompatibility between your current graphics card driver and this operating system** . Updating your graphics drivers can fix some game issues, such as game crashing.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  /[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), downloading the latest correct installer and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to do that manually, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to update automatically:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![update all drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 4) Launch the game and check whether it works without any crashes. Ty running Rainbow Six Extraction either on Vulkan (this requires the latest graphics driver) or DirectX 11.

### 5\. Disable conflicting apps

 Antivirus software like BitDefender is known to interfere with your Rainbow Six Extraction. You might need to disable any antivirus software installed on your PC temporarily.

 This also includes some utility programs provided by your hardware manufacturers that change your components or system settings (MSI Afterburner or Corsair Utility Engine, for example).

 To find out the problematic app, you can try[**performing a clean boot**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . This allows your PC to run without any unnecessary startups. If your game stops crashing, then you need to enable the startup item one by one to find the problematic one.

### 6\. Disable SMT

Some Rainbow Six Extraction players find it helps when they disable SMT.

 SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) is released by AMD to improve the performance of its Ryzen CPUs. However, sometimes SMT can cause problems with some applications.

 To disable SMT, you should enter BIOS ([**learn how**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ) and find the **SMT** or **SMT mode** setting and set it to **Disabled** .

 If this setting is not listed, you may need to **[update your BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
