 After the reboot, launch Halo Infinite and test your gameplay. If it still keeps freezing, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU.**If you’re using an outdated graphics driver** while playing a demanding game such as Halo Infinite, you’re more likely to encounter the freezing issue. In this case, you should update your graphics driver. It can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make your game run smoothly.

 To update your graphics driver, you can do it manually by visiting the page:[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and download and install the latest driver.

## 3\. Delete temp files

 Temp files are referred to temporary files, which are files that your operating system only needed to exist temporarily while in use. But they are now just wasting space. This can slow down your PC and significantly affects the performance. To fix it, you can delete the files and it won’t cause any problems. Below are the steps you can follow.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo +** **R** **keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Enter**%temp%** into the box and press Enter.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/delete-temp-files-new-1.png)
3. Press the**Ctrl + A keys** simultaneously to select all files. Then right-click and select**Delete** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/delete-all-the-files.png)
4. If you receive the following prompt, simply check the box next to**Do this for all current items** and click**Skip** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![delete temporary files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/skip-for-all-current-items.png)
5. When it finishes deleting all temp files, head to your desktop. Right-click**Recycling Bin** and select**Empty Recycling Bin** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/empty-recycle-bin.png)

 Now launch Halo Infinite. If your problem persists, move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Disable background applications

 Games require a considerable amount of memory to function properly. If too many unwanted or unnecessary programs keep running in the background, there will be insufficient memory, which causes the freezing issue. To solve the problem, you can disable some background applications.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys** simultaneously to bring up the Task Manager.
2. From here, you can take a look at all the programs that are eating up your memory.

<a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818" border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-Manager-Memory.png)
3. Locate the applications that are eating up a lot of memory. If you don’t need them while playing Halo Infinite, right-click each of them and select**End task** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/disable-background-applications.png)

 If you use Razer Synapse, make sure you turn it off while playing Halo Infinite. Some players found that it affects your gameplay. It could be possible that Razer Synapse is in conflict with your game.

 If turning off background applications doesn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 A variety of issues may be caused by corrupted game files, e.g. glitched graphics. If you encounter the freezing issue, verify the cache files of Halo Infinite, which can help ensure that the installation is up-to-date and if necessary, repair any bad or corrupted game data. Thus, this can help you rule out the cause of your problem and fix it.

To verify the integrity of your game files, follow the steps below:

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Under the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab. Then click**Verify integrity of game files…** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/verify-integrity-of-game-fiiles.png)

 Now Steam will verify your game’s files. This process may take several minutes. Once the process is completed, close the Window then launch your game. If it still keeps freezing, move on to the next fix.

## 6\. Uninstall Multiplayer High-Res Textures

 Another great way to improve Halo Infinite’s performance is to uninstall Multiplayer High-Res Textures. This may also give you a noticeable FPS boost. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Under the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Select the**DLC** tab. Then uncheck**Multiplayer High-Res Textures** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723" border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/disable-multiplayer-high-res-textures.png)

If this doesn’t help, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Disable in-game overlay

 Halo Infinite’s in-game overlay is a feature that aims to improve your gaming experience. But sometimes they just do the opposite of that, eating up bandwidth or introducing compatibility problems. In this case, you’ll need to disable it. Follow the instructions below to do so.

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Under the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-verified-1.jpg)
3. Select the**GENERAL** tab. Then uncheck**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/disable-in-game-overlay.png)

 Now relaunch your game and you should be able to play in rows without having the annoying freezing issue.

 However, if none of the methods listed above work for you, it’s high time you run a scan of your PC and check if you have **corrupted, malfunctioning, and missing Windows software files** , which will cause performance issues.

 To do this, try using **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a **100% legitimate** program that specializes in Windows repair. Additionally, it increases performance, stops computer freezing and system crashes as well as improves overall PC stability. With regular use, Fortect will constantly refresh your operating system which will keep your computer running at its best.

2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Once the scan is finished, you’ll see a complete overview of your system and issues.
3. Click **Start Repair** to start the repair process and wait for Fortect to fix the problem.

When it’s completed, launch Halo Infinite and test the gameplay.
