## Fix 3: Reinstall your drivers

 Outdated or wrong drivers could cause trouble. When you meet computer problems but have no clue to fix them, you can update related drivers for a try. Keeping your drivers updated can help you enhance device functions to improve computer performance.

 There are two ways you can update your drivers: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-logitech-c920-webcam-not-working/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer’s official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2 – Automatically update drivers

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/de-scan-6.1.png)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.

## Fix 4: Disable conflict apps

 There’s a situation where your webcam stops working because of other programs. The conflict apps could be Skype, Discord, VPN, or others. According to our readers,**VPN provided by Malwarebytes** is one of the conflicting apps.  
 To fix the problem, simply switch the conflicting app off, or disable it through Task Manager.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys together to open the**Task Manager** .
2. Find the conflicting app and click**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/steam-end-task.png)
3. Reboot your camera to check.

## Fix 5: Repair system files

 Sometimes corrupted system files and hardware issues will lead to all kinds of errors. To identify the cause and repair it, you don’t have to check those components one by one but perform a quick automatic system scan.

 You can use[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to run an automatic system scan and repair systems with one-click. It is a powerful tool that specializes in Windows repair and cleaning to get your PC optimized. It scans to get full visibility of your PC health so that it can repair and replace damaged or missing files on your computer (registry keys, DLL files, etc). It’s like a fresh reinstallation of Windows, but keep your programs, user data, and settings as they are.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
