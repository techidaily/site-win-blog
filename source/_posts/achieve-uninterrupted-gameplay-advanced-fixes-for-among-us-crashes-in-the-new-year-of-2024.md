### Fix 2: Verify your game files

 The constant crash may indicate an**integrity issue with your game files** . If that’s the case, your game might keep crashing at a certain scene or chapter. You should make sure there’s nothing wrong with your game files.

Here’s an example of how to check the game integrity on Steam:

1. Open your Steam client. Navigate to the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click**Detroit: Become Human** and select**Properties** .

<a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754" border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/detroit-become-human-verify-game-01.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab, then select**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/detroit-become-human-verify-game-02.jpg)
3. Wait until the checking to finish.

You can then launch Detroit: Become Human and see if it crashes again.

 If this solution doesn’t work for you, please continue to the next one.

### Fix 3:**Close all** background**applications**

 Detroit: Become Human is a demanding game, and the crash can occur when you have some other large programs eating up your CPU resources and RAM. So if you’re running big programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** or**Windows Update** , be sure to close them before launching your game.

If this fix failed to solve your issue, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 More often than not, the crash of new games tends to be graphics-related. It usually indicates that you’re using**a** **faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Whether you’re using a 1,000 dollars gaming rig or just a five-year-old school laptop, always make sure you make the most out of it, with the latest graphics driver.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, first visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then search for your exact GPU model. Remember to download the latest correct installer that’s compatible with your operating system. And always restart your PC after updating device drivers.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

### Fix 6: Disable in-game overlays

For example, you can follow these steps to disable Steam overlay:

1. Open your**Steam client** . In the top left corner, click**Steam** select**Settings** .
