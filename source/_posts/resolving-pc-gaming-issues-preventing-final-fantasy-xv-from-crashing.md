### Fix 2: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Minecraft Dungeons constantly release game patches to add new features and fix the known bugs. If you haven’t updated your game to the most recent version, you should give it a try to see if it can resolve your crashing issue.

 Minecraft Dungeons should update to the latest version automatically. But if not, you can update your game manually. Here’s how:

1. Open**Microsoft Store** .
2. At the top right corner, click the**three dots** , then select**Downloads and Updates** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/downloads-updates-1.jpg)
3. Click**Get Updates** . Then all your applications should update (including Minecraft Dungeons).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/get-updates.jpg)

 After updating your game, relaunch Minecraft Dungeons to see if your problem is resolved.

If the crashing issue remains, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game crashes is that you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix the potential problem and enjoy a better game experience, you should update your graphics driver to the latest version.

 There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 — Update your graphics driver manually

 You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) for your GPU, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

#### Option 2 — Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scan-18.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-geforce-gtx960m-1.jpg)

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and launch Minecraft Dungeons to see if the game crashes again.

If the issue persists, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates often bring new features and security improvements. If you don’t remember the last time you updated your system, you can try to check for updates manually and see if it helps. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open Settings.
2. Click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/update.jpg)
3. Under Windows Update, click**Check for updates** . Windows will automatically download and install the available updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/check-for-updates.jpg)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer and launch Minecraft Dungeons to see if the crashing issue is resolved.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, try the next one.

### Fix 5: Repair your game

 The crashing issue in Minecraft Dungeons may occur due to the corrupted game files. If you’re on Windows 10, you can try repairing the game without reinstalling it. The game’s data won’t be affected. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open Settings.
2. Click**Apps** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-settings-apps.jpg)
3. Under Apps & features, click**Minecraft Dungeons** , then click**Advanced options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-dungeons-advanced-options.jpg)
4. Scroll down the page, then click**Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/repair-minecraft-dungeons.jpg)

 Now you can relaunch Minecraft Dungeons to check if the game works properly.

If this fix doesn’t work for you, check out the next one.

### Fix 6: Modify in-game graphics settings

 High graphics settings in Minecraft Dungeons are likely to overload your system and may cause the crashing issue. So you can modify the in-game graphics settings to alleviate the stress of your PC and improve the game’s performance. Here’s how:

1. Open Minecraft Dungeons and go to**Settings** .
2. Click**Display / Graphics** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-dungeons-display-graphics.jpg)
3. Select**Advanced Graphics** .
