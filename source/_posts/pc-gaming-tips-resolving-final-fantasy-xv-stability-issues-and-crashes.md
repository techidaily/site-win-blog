### Fix 1: Do not overclock your CPU

 Overclocking your CPU will bring the best performance when playing games. However, this can cause your game to crash when increasing your CPU frequency.

 So if your computer is overclocking your CPU, try to**set it back to default** and see if it helps with your Final Fantasy crashing issue.

### Fix 2: Verify the game files

 Final Fantasy may crash if there is any corrupted game file, so you can try verifying integrity of game files in Steam app if games crash. Here’s how to do it:

1) Open Steam in your computer, and log into your Steam account.

2) Click**Library** .

 5) Steam will check your game files and fix any detected problems. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

 6) Restart Steam, and open Final Fantasy XV again and see if it works properly.

 If your game stops crashing, that’s perfect. But if your problem persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Roll back your graphics card driver

 If you’ve updated your graphics card driver right before Final Fantasy keeps crashing, your problem probably lies in your graphics card driver. In this case, you can roll back your graphics driver.

 There are two ways to roll back your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

* Manually roll back your driver: you can roll back your graphics card driver by navigating to**Device Manager** \>**Display adapters** \>**Properties** \>**Driver** \>**Roll Back Driver** .

This requires time and computer skills.

7) After changing your pagefile size, restart Windows.

 Open Final Fantasy and see if it stops crashing. Still no luck? Don’t give up hope. There are other solutions.

### Fix 5: Disable NVIDIA Turf Effects

 NVIDIA Turf Effects simulates and renders large grass areas, which provides you with a best possible experience when playing Final Fantasy. However, Turf Effects may cause a memory problem and that could be a reason of your game crashing.

To resolve Final Fantasy crashing, you can disable NVIDIA Turf Effects.

 1) Launch FFXV**Settings** .

 2) Go to**Graphics** \>**NVIDIA TurfEffects** . Then set it to**Off** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Snap51.jpg)

3) Save your changes and relaunch FFXV.

 If you can’t open Settings in Final Fantasy XV, you can modify the game settings file in your computer, and change**NvidiaTurf=0** . This will disable NVIDIA Turf Effects for your game.

Hopefully your game will be running up again properly.

### Fix 6: Reinstall your game
