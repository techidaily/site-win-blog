## 3\. Update the graphics driver

 If this error code 80070057 persists after you tried “Scan and Repair” and “Check for Updates”, it is mainly related to the video file, which can be caused by an outdated/corrupt driver or driver incompatibility.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
