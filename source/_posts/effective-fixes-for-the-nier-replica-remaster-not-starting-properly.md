## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 Low FPS, lagging gameplay, or poor graphics aren’t always caused by an old graphics card. Sometimes, updating your graphics driver can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make your game significantly run smoother. Moreover, updating your graphics can ensure that you always have the newest features. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now as it can make a big difference.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by heading to the manufacturer’s driver download page:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

## 6\. Turn off hardware acceleration

 By default, hardware acceleration is enabled in Chrome and Discord. This feature utilizes your computer’s GPU to tackle graphics-intensive tasks. But it can cause your computer’s battery to drain a lot faster. In order to get the best possible gaming experience, you should disable hardware acceleration, which may also give you a noticeable FPS boost.

 Here’s how to turn off hardware acceleration in Chrome and Discord:

## 7\. Disable Windows 10 gaming features

 Game Mode is a feature in Windows 10 that focuses system resources on games when enabled. It was supposed to make gaming a much better experience, but it seems the opposite is true. And if you have background recording enabled on your system, it may make your game laggy and even your FPS suffers. To get rid of framerate drops, you need to disable the background recording feature and turn off Game Mode.

Here’s how to do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press **Windows + R keys** simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click **Gaming** .  
  
![disable windows 10 gaming features disable game mode](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gaming-in-the-settings.png)

 3) From the left pane, select **Game bar** and toggle off **Record game clips, screenshots, and broadcast using Game bar** .

 5) From the left sidebar, select **Game Mode** . Then toggle off **Game Mode** .

![turn off game mode windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/turn-off-game-mode.jpg)
