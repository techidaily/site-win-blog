 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.

2. Type**cmd** and press the**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** key to run as administrator.
3. Type`**ipconfig /release**` and press**Enter** .
4. Type`**ipconfig /flushdns**` and press**Enter** to flush the DNS cache.
5. Type`**ipconfig /renew**` and press**Enter** to renew the IP configuration for the active adapters.
6. Close the Command Prompt and reboot the game to check.
