### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 If you’re using the wrong graphics driver or it’s outdated, it’s very likely that Football Manager 2021 will crash and malfunction. To run FM 21 smoothly, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can download the latest driver from graphics card manufacturers like **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and then install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

### Fix 3 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Antivirus is known to interfere with Football Manager 2021 and your Steam or Epic game launcher. To see if that’s the case, you could disable the antivirus programs first. In case you don’t know how, below are some links for your reference.

* [AVG](https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en&urlname=Disable-AVG-Antivirus)
* [Avast](https://support.avast.com/en-ca/article/167/)
* [McAfee](https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/faces/oracle/webcenter/page/scopedMD/s55728c97%5F466d%5F4ddb%5F952d%5F05484ea932c6/Page29.jspx?articleTitle=McAfee+KB+-+%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%9C%A8+Windows+%E6%88%96+macOS+%E4%B8%8A%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E8%BF%88%E5%85%8B%E8%8F%B2%E9%98%B2%E7%81%AB%E5%A2%99+%28TS101322%29&locale=en-AU&%5Fadf.ctrl-state=1o7a5hld6%5F4&wc.contextURL=%2Fspaces%2Fcp&articleId=TS101322&%5FafrLoop=152281897470282#!)
* [Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/uk/home/current/solutions/v3672136)

 Once you confirmed the antivirus is the culprit of Football Manager 2021 crashing, you need to add both the game launcher and FM 21 to its exceptions, or completely uninstall the program.

If this method doesn’t help, go ahead with the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Delete the Preferences and Caches folder

 According to Sports Interactive, Football Manager 2021 crashing may be caused by the custom data, and the very solution is to remove the preferences and caches folder. Don’t worry as this will not affect your game progress.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open the File Explorer.
2. Click the**View** tab and make sure**Hidden items** is ticked.

3. Navigate to the following locations:  
 **C:\\Users\\\[Your Windows Username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Sports Interactive\\Football Manager 2021**
4. Delete the**Preferences** and**Caches** folder.

So does the crash go away now? If not, there is the last fix to try.

### Fix 5 – Set launch options

 If you receive a specific DXGI\_ERROR\_DEVICE error message or an application error, the Football Manager 2021 crashing issue is related to your graphics card. That’s especially true if you’re using Intel GPUs. And you can launch the game with lower graphics settings and see how it works.

1. Open Steam and go to the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-1-5.jpg)
2. Right-click**Football Manager 2021** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-2-8.jpg)
3. Click**Set Launch Options** .

4. Type**–config very\_low** in the text field and click**OK** .

 Such setting may render FM 2021 in lower performance, but it will mitigate the crashing effectively.
