### **Fix 2: update your graphics driver to the latest version**

 This issue is probably caused by your outdated graphics driver. Updating your graphics driver to the latest version can make your game run smoother and prevents many issues or errors.

 There are two ways you can get the right graphics driver: manually or automatically.

**Option 1 – Manually –** You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

Or

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) –** This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Your graphics card manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically udpate your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![Driver Easy Scan Screen](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Driver-Easy-Scan-screen.jpg)

 3) Click**Update** next to your graphics card to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee).

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at[**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### **Fix 3: Run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter**

 This issue may occur if Origin is not compatible for your current Windows operating system. If you’re net sure, run the**Program Compatibility Troubleshooter** . The **Program Compatibility Troubleshooter**  can check whether that program is compatible for your current Windows operating system or not. Just follow the steps below to run the **Program Compatibility Troubleshooter** :

 1) Right-click the shortcut to Origin on your desktop and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap10-3.png)

 4) If it still doesn’t work, then run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter again and**select the second option** **to choose compatibility settings based on problems you notice** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pasted-image-2-1-1.png)

 5) If the problem persists, adjust the following settings manually and select**OK** when you’re done.

* **Compatibility mode:**  If Origin won’t open on your current Windows system, click the drop-down list to select a previous version of Windows system to test-run it.
* **Disable fullscreen optimizations:**  Some games on Origin are particularly affected by the low FPS issue, and some of them even crash when the player enable fullscreen optimizations.**Just disable it** to see whether Origin will open or not.

### **Fix 4: Add Origin as an exception to your third-party antivirus application**

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Origin.

 Since Origin consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and Origin may not run as expected. You can try   **adding Origin as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
