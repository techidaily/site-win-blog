## Install the latest game patch

 The developer of WRC 10 FIA World Rally Championship releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Try adding both the game folder and Steam (or Epic Games Launcher if you play the game on the Epic platform ) as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable your 3rd party antivirus software before playing.

 Run WRC 10 and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

 If the game crashing issue persists, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.
