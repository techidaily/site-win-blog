### Fix 1: Check your Internet connection

 When connection problems occur, checking out your network status should always be your go-to option.

 Now, try opening another application that requires Internet access to function. If that application fails, too, then you’ve found the core problem. Check **[this article](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to troubleshoot your network issue.

If the application is working fine, read on and try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Restart your computer

 In some cases, the Outlook connection issue is caused by software conflicts. If you’re running multiple programs on your PC, chances are that one of your application conflicts with Outlook and causes it to fail.

Ensure there are no unsaved files before you proceed.

 Restart your computer to wipe away the current state of the software and clear memory. Then, reopen Outlook to test your issue.

 If the problem continues to occur after the reboot, go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 3: Turn off the Work Offline mode

 Outlook may also disconnect from the Internet because users accidentally turned on the Offline mode. Although it’s rare, you should not rule out the possibility. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run**Outlook** .

**2)** Click the**Send / Receive** tab. Next, verify that the**Work Offline mode** is turned off.

 If the background of the**Work Offline button** is dark-grey, that means the Work Offline mode is active. You’ll need to turn off the mode by clicking the button once.

If the Work Offline mode is already disabled, move on to the next fix.
