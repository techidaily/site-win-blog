### Fix 1:**Meet the minimum system requirements**

 To run _**War Thunder**_ on your PC, make sure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements; otherwise, you’ll need to play the game on another computer.

**The minimum requirements to play** _**War Thunder**_ **:**
**OS:** Windows 7/Vista/8/10  
**Processor:** 2.2 GHz  
**Memory:** 4 GB RAM  
**Graphics:** Intel HD Graphics 4000 / AMD Radeon 46XX / NVIDIA GeForce GT 520  
**DirectX:** Version 10

**Here is how to view your hardware information:**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2: **Restart your computer**

 Some programs running on your PC may conflict with **_War Thunder_** , causing it to crash constantly. To see if that’s the problem for you, try restarting your computer to end unwanted programs completely, then relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If**_War Thunder_** still crashes your computer, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: **Run your game as an Administrator**

_**War Thunder**_ or Steam sometimes can’t access certain game files on your computer under normal user mode, which could result in the crashing issue. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running Steam as an administrator, then launch your game from Steam. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Exit Steam.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon** on your desktop and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png)

**3)**  Click the **Compatibility tab** and check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** . Then, click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1.png)

**4)**  Relaunch Steam and**War Thunder** to test your issue.

 You can hopefully run the game without crashing now. If the problem still exists, then go ahead with the fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: **Install the latest game patch**

 The developers of **_War Thunder_** release regular game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from running correctly, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 To check if there is any update, go to the **[War Thunder website](https://warthunder.com/en/game/changelog/) [](https://remnant.ghost.io/)**  and search for the latest patch**.**  If a patch is available, install it, then run your game again to check whether the crashing problem has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Verify the integrity of game files

**_War Thunder_** may crash when a certain game file is damaged or missing. To fix it, try verifying the integrity of your game files on the Steam client. Here is how:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-321.png)

**3)**  Right-click **War Thunder** and select **Properties.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**4)**  Click the **LOCAL FILES**  tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Wait for the scans to be complete, then relaunch your game to see if your problem has been resolved. If not, try the next fix.

### Fix 6: **Update your graphics driver**

_**War Thunder**_ crashing issues might occur if you’re using a faulty graphics driver, or it’s outdated. It’s essential that you have the latest graphics driver at all times.

There are two ways you can get the latest correct graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-war-thunder-crash-2019-tips/#f2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating drivers. To get the latest graphics driver, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-201.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Restart your PC and game after the update is complete.

If your issue persists, then try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Change your PC’s Power Settings

 The power plan on all computers is set to Balanced by default to save more energy, so your computer sometimes will slow down to save energy, which could cause War Thunder to crash. Follow the instructions below to see how to fix it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .
