### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Make sure you have the latest driver for your graphic card. If you don’t have the latest graphics driver, then it can cause lots of problems. With outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter game issues including crashing, stuttering, lagging, and more.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

**Option 1 – Manually** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers. Go to the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Search for your GPU model to download and install. Make sure the driver is compatible with your operating system.

OR

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.  
 You don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 3: Rename the file folder

 A few gamers indicate renaming the modern warfare files would fix the Warzone Pacific crashing issue. Also, check MW file location and check the data folder for any corrupted files making the game unstable. You’d better back up data before trying this method. Because it will wipe all your in-game settings.

1. In the File Explorer, go to the Call of Duty Modern Warfare folder.
2. Rename the**Modern Warfare** file to**.85** .
3. Run Battle.net.
4. Click the**gear** button and click**Scan and Repair** .
5. Launch Warzone Pacific to check if the issue persists.

 If this method doesn’t resolve the issue, you can restore the changes with the backup.

### Fix 4: Change the in-game settings

 Lowering the in-game graphics settings might help fix Warzone Pacific crashing. The Modern Warfare program occupied too much virtual memory and it could cause the game to crash. To fix it, you can lower all graphic settings, including turning off on demand streaming textures.

1. Launch Warzone Pacific.
2. Go to**Settings > Graphics** .
3. Lower all graphic settings.
4. Back to the game.

If it fixes the issue then slowly increase your graphics settings.

### Fix 5: Reinstall Warzone Pacific

 If none of the fixes work for you, you may reinstall Warzone Pacific to see the result. Some gamers have reported doing a clean reinstall of Warzone Pacific would help.

1. Press the Search button on the bottom of your screen.
2. Type**control panel** and press the**Enter** key.
