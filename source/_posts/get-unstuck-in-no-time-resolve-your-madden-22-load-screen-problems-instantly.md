2. **Wait** for one minute.
3. **Reconnect** the modem and router to the power outlet. Make sure the indicators are back to their normal state.

 Once you’re back online, restart Madden 22 to see if you can get past the loading screen.

1. On your desktop, right-click Madden NFL 22 icon and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/properties.jpg)

### Fix 4: Update your network driver

 Being stuck on the loading screen could indicate that you have a poor connection, which can be caused by a broken or outdated network driver. To fix this issue, you need to make sure you’re using the latest network driver.

 One way to do that is to visit the motherboard manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support?mktsrc=drivereasy%5Fen%5F153179) ,[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/?mktsrc=drivereasy%5Fen%5F153179) ) and search for your model, then download and install the network driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/de-scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

### Fix 6: Delete game data on Xbox

1. On Xbox Home, select **My games & apps** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/my-games-apps.jpg)

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/disable-service.jpg)
6. Restart your computer.

 Once you restart your computer, try launching Madden 22 again and check if the game is still stuck on the loading screen. If not, you can try to enable services one by one until you find the problematic software. Then restart your computer to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic program that conflicts with Madden 22, you just need to uninstall it to avoid the issue in the future.

 If the game still won’t load after you disabled all the programs and services, try the last fix below.

### Fix 8: Use a VPN

 If Madden 22 is still stuck on the loading screen after you try all the fixes above, maybe give VPN a shot. By using a VPN, you can get a better Internet connection during rush hours, which may help you to solve the problem of Madden 22 not loading. Here are some VPNs we recommended:

* **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Surfshark](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[CyberGhost](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Avoid using free VPNs, since they rarely resolve your issues but could bring many problems.
