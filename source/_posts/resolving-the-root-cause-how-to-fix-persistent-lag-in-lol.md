## Fix 3: Update your GPU drivers

 For game players, the GPU driver plays a significant role in improving your game performance and ensuring a wonderful gaming experience. If the graphics card driver is outdated or corrupt, you will bump into various game issues such as the game crashing or not launching, and in your particular case – VRChat crashing.

There are two ways for you to update your drivers:

 Option 1 – **[Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

**OR**

 Option 2 – **[Automatically (Recommended](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-vrchat-crashing/#o2)**  ) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers like NVIDIA and AMD keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs and improve performance, so you can always get the latest driver on their official website.

* [NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NVIDIA-driver-1.jpg)
* [AMD Driver Downloads](https://www.amd.com/en/support)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AMD-driver-downloads-1.jpg)

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. After that, don’t forget to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

### Step 2: Add VRChat as an exception in the Antivirus application

 If you’ve ever installed an antivirus program, you should follow the links below to exclude your VRChat in your antivirus app.

## Fix 5: Delete VRChat files

 VRChat official has provided an automatic method for users who are experiencing VRChat crashing or VRChat not launching issues. All you need is to run Command Prompt as administrator and run a few commands:

1. On your Windows search bar, type **cmd** . Right-click Command Prompt from the results and select **Run as administrator** .  
![how to open Command Prompt as an admin](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-Command-Prompt-Run-as-administrator.jpg)  

 You’ll be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open the Command Prompt.
2. Copy this command with**Ctrl + C** , and paste it into the cmd window by right-clicking in the window.  

` **rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatCookies && rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatHTTPCache && rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatUnity && rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatVRCHTTPCache && rmdir /S /Q %TEMP%VRChat && REG DELETE HKCUSoftwareVRChatvrchat /va** `
3. Press**Enter** to run this command.
4. When prompted for permission to delete all keys under the VRChat key, press**Y** and hit**Enter** .
5. If this command gives you error messages such as not finding the exact file path, you can run the following command in cmd to clear the VRChat cache:  

` **rmdir /S /Q %USERPROFILE%AppDataLocalLowVRChatvrchat && rmdir /S /Q %TEMP%VRChat && REG DELETE HKCUSoftwareVRChatvrchat /va** `

 The first command includes multiple commands in a single line by putting && in between them.

 After clearing the cache, you can check if the VRChat crashing still persists.

 You can also check its **[support article](https://help.vrchat.com/kb/article/17-i-crashedcant-launch-vrchatother-issues/)**  to learn how to do it manually if the command doesn’t work for you.

## Fix 6: Create a VRChat account

 If the methods above failed to help, then you can try creating a new VRChat account then link your Steam/Oculus account with your VRChat account on[VRChat official website](https://www.vrchat.com/) .

To merge your Steam account with your VRChat account:

1. Log into VRChat with your Steam/Oculus account.
2. Open your quick menu, then select**Settings** .
3. Click**Upgrade Account** near the bottom of that menu, then follow the instructions on the screen to merge your accounts.

## Fix 7: Turn off SteamVR Beta

 SteamVR is the ultimate tool for experiencing VR content on the hardware of your choice. However, many users reported that SteamVR Beta has caused their VRChat to crash.

 You can either turn off SteamVR Beta or roll it back to a more stable version.

## Fix 8: Use VPN

 Sadly, for many users, the only solution is using a VPN. This is mainly because your ISP has filtered or throttled your internet connection for VRChat, thus causing your VRChat to crash randomly.

 If all of these fixes fail, the last resort is using a VPN to connect to VRChat. We suggest **[Nord VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as it’s the most powerful and secure VPN at a reasonable price, and you can get **[Nord VPN coupons](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to save up to 83% of your money.

 Be careful about free VPN services, although it definitely sounds good about what they claim: **100% FREE and SAFE** , the reality is always the opposite. They will make money out of you later on.
