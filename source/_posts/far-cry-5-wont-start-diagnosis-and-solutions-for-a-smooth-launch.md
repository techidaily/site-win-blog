### Fix 1: Make sure your specs meet the minimum requirements

 The new Call of Duty installment is no doubt a demanding game, both to your shooting skills and PC specs. So before you dive into any advanced troubleshooting, the first thing you want to do is**make sure your PC setup meets the minimum game requirements** . Because if it doesn‚Äôt, then you should get ready for the upcoming Black Friday.

#### Minimum requirements for Black Ops Cold War

| **OS:**       | Windows 7 64-Bit (SP1) or Windows 10 64-Bit (1803 or later)     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU:**      | Intel Core i3-4340 or AMD FX-6300                               |
| **RAM:**      | 8GB RAM                                                         |
| **Graphics:** | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 / GeForce GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon HD 7950 |

Minimum

 If your gaming rig is powerful enough for the game, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2: Scan and repair game files

 The not launching might indicate**an integrity issue** with your game files. You can follow these steps to check and repair any missing or corrupted files:

1. Open your**Blizzard Battle.net** client. From the left menu, select**Call of Duty: BOCW** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-verify.jpg)
2. Click**Options** and select**Scan and Repair** . Then wait until the checking finishes.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-verify-2.jpg)

You can now launch Black Ops Cold War and see if it‚Äôs working.

 If this method doesn‚Äôt help your case, simply check out the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The game-not-launching issue tends to be graphics-related. In other words, you could be using**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . If you can‚Äôt remember the last time you updated your GPU driver, definitely do it now.

 Both[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-game-ready-driver/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-20-11-1) had released driver optimized for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. See below for update instructions.

 Of course you can update manually: first go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then search, download and install the graphics driver step by step. But if you don‚Äôt like playing with device drivers, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do these automatically:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ‚Äì you‚Äôll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don‚Äôt want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy‚Äôs support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you‚Äôve updated your graphics driver, restart your PC and check if Black Ops Cold War is working now.

 If updating your graphics driver doesn‚Äôt give you any luck, you can move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 If this solution doesn‚Äôt work for you, simply continue to the next one.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/afterburner.jpg)

MSI Afterburner

 While overclocking is surely a zero-cost benefit, it can also be the trigger of system instability. And according to Activision, Black Ops Cold War does not get along well with overclocking utilities. So if you‚Äôre using overclocking software, such as**MSI Afterburner** and**Razer Cortex** or have enabled overclocking in BIOS settings, try stopping that and see if it allows you to start the game.

 If you‚Äôre not overclocking in the first place, you can try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Launch Black Ops Cold War in DirectX 11

 Some veterans reported that they managed to get Black Ops Cold War working by using**DirectX 11** . So you can try the same and see how it goes.

Here‚Äôre the steps:

1. Open your Blizzard Battle.net client.
2. From the left menu, select**Call of Duty: BOCW** . Click**Options** and select**Game Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-d11-1.jpg)
3. Check the box next to**Additional command line arguments** . In the input box, type or paste**\-d3d11** (note the dash). Then click**Done** to apply the changes.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now you can check if Black Ops Cold War is working properly.

### Fix 7: Check if your system is corrupted
