 This problem can also be caused by the**hardware issue** . So you can try to troubleshoot the hardware and solve the problem.

### 1\. Put your PS4 in an open space

 The PS4 freezing issue can possibly because of an**overheating problem** . If the PS4 doesn’t have enough space for the air to cool download the fan, it may be overheated and stuck in.

 If that’s the case, you can try to**put your PS4 in an open space** to have more gas around it, so your PS4 is allowed to have**better air circulation** . Additionally, you may need to regularly**clean the dust** on your PS4 to have it under maintenance.

### 2\. Check all the cables and ports to be plugged correctly
