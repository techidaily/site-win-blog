### Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum hardware requirements

 The PUBG stuttering issue may occur if your PC fails to meet the minimum hardware requirements of the game. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements:

* **The minimum hardware requirements for PUBG:**

| **OS:**        | 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | Intel Core i5-4430 / AMD FX-6300                   |
| **Graphics:**  | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 2GB / AMD Radeon R7 370 2GB |
