 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.
