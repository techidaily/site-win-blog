## Disable Movie / Film Grain, Depth Of Field, Post-Process Effects

 The in-game graphics settings like Movie / Film Grain, Depth Of Field and Post-Process Effects are common in video games. However, those in-game graphics settings are also the main cause of FPS drops and crashing.

 The game doesn’t provide options to disable those in-game graphics settings. If you need to disble those settings, follow the instructions below:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Copy the path below and paste it to the Run dialog. Then click OK to open it.  
**`%LOCALAPPDATA%\TheAscent\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`**  
![Run dialog](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Run-dialog.jpg)
2. Open the file**Engine.ini** in Notepad.
3. To disble Moive / Film Grain, add the following and save the file:  

` **[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0** `
4. Add the following to the Engine.ini file and save it to disable Depth of Field:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**
5. If you’d like to disable all of them, then don’t add these commands separately. Do it like this:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.SceneColorFringeQuality=0**  
 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**
6. Launch the game again after you save the Engine.ini file.

 See if it crashes after you disable those in-game graphics settings. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Some 3rd party antivirus software would interfere with the game, and may even block the game files. Sometimes it may also lead to the game crashing issues.

 Try adding both Steam and the game folder as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. Before running the game, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software.

 Run The Ascent and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.
