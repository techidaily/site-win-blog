## Try these fixes

 Except for hardware issue, the “Skyrim no sound” issue can be caused by software; driver; incorrect settings or the corrupted game files.  
 Before we dig in deeply, let’s try the simplest but most useful way first–**restart your steam and your computer** .  
 If the reboot doesn’t work, let’s try other fixes. You don’t need to try them all, work your way down till find the one that works for you.

1. **[Check your headset software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

4. **[Install DirectX from the Skyrim](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your headset software

 If your headset has a supporting software, you need to check it first. In case it was muted there. Take the Razer headset for example. You need to go into Razer Synapse to check, if it was muted in the software, you won’t get sound.
