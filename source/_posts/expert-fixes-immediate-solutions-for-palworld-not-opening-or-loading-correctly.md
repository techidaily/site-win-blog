![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be9593219518-1024x627.jpg)

 Recently, many Fortnite PC players have been reporting that**Fortnite gets stuck on the loading screen** . For some, they canâ€™t get past the Fortnite screen in the beginning after clicking**Launch** with the Epic Launcher. For others, after they select a game mode, Fortnite finds a game but gets stuck on the loading screen into the match.

 If youâ€™re experiencing this problem, donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s fixable! And in most cases, the fix is pretty fast and simpleâ€¦

### Fix 1: If you use a Nvidia graphics card, close all Nvidia programs in Task Manager

 If you use a Nvidia graphics card and Fortnite gets stuck on the loading screen, some Nvidia programs running in the background may be causing the problem. A quick fix for it is to open up your Task Manger and close all Nvidia-related programs.

1. Right-click on your task bar, and select**Task Manger** .

2. Scroll through and end each**NVIDIA** task.  
 Note: 1-3 may relaunch themselves, which is perfectly normal and fine. Youâ€™re basically restarting those programs.

### Fix 2: If you use Geforce Experience, turn off the share in-game overlay

1. From the GeForce Experience app, click the**Settings** icon in the upper right corner.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If fixes 1 and 2 above didnâ€™t work for you, the most likely cause is a graphics card driver problem.

Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics card driver manually** â€” You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturerâ€™s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver thatâ€™s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics card driver automatically** â€” If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bea4c9c13ba1.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bea4d0c0cbac.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and check if Fortnite now runs properly. If it doesnâ€™t, contact Driver Easyâ€™s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. Theyâ€™d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to Fix 4, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Run Fortnite as administrator

 Running an application as administrator can give you administrative rights to use the app. And this will hopefully fix the Fortnite stuck on loading screen problem.

1. Make sure Fortnite is closed.
2. Right-click the Epic Games Launcher icon, and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bea7ba318699.jpg)
3. Click**Yes** if prompted by User Account Control for confirmation.
4. Test if the problem is resolved. If not, try the next fix.

---

### Fix 5: Check for account issues

 If youâ€™ve tried the above but nothing seems to be working, youâ€™d better make sure itâ€™s not an account problem.

 To check for it, you can try logging in to Fortnite on a friendâ€™s computer. If it works properly, you can conclude that your Fortnite account is fine and the problem is with your computer. Then you can try other troubleshooting steps.

 If youâ€™re also unable to log in to Fortnite on a different computer, you need to contact Fortniteâ€™s support to help solve your problem.
