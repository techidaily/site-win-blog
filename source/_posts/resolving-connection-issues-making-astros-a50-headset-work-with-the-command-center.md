### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If your graphics driver is outdated or corrupted, it may cause the game FPS drops issue. Updating the graphics driver can not only enhance the performance of your graphics card, but also avoid many unexpected computer issues in the future.

 There are two ways to update your graphics driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics driver manually** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact graphics card model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DE-csan-screen-2.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.  
![Driver Easy update graphics driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Driver-Easy-update-graphics-driver-1.png)

 Don’t worry; it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don’t like it you can get a full refund, no questions asked.

### Fix 6: Temporarily disable the third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Day.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and DayZ may not run as expected. You can try temporarily turning off your third-party antivirus application to see if this issue persists.

 If the game can run smoothly after you disabled the third-party antivirus application, you should add the Steam client and the executable file of DayZ as exceptions to your third-party antivirus application.

 If you don’t know how to add a program as an exception to your third-party application, please consult the documentation of your antivirus application..

Try the next fix below if this fix didn’t work for you.

### Fix 7: Change the power plan of your PC

 Most PC are configured to **Balanced** , which may limits the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU. If the power plan of your PC is **Power saver**  or **Balanced** , you might run into the game FPS drops issue.

 To fix the game lag issue, try changing the power plan of your PC to **High performance** . Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)

 Launch DayZ to see if you resolve the FPS drops issue. If not, try the next fix below to adjust your Windows system for the best performance.

### Fix 8: Adjust your Windows system for the best performance

 If your PC fails to meet the recommended system requirements for DayZ, try adjusting your Windows system for the best performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **control sysdm.cpl** and press **Enter** to open the**System Properties** window.
