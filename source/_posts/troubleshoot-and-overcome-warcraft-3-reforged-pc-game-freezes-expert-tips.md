### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 A smooth and pleasant gaming performance also depends on your graphics card driver. If it’s incompatible, corrupt or out-of-date, you’ll run into various issues including Warcraft 3 crashing. To keep your graphics driver up-to-date, you should update it **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers will regularly roll out new drivers on their official websites:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**

 You need to find the driver that exactly corresponds with your Windows version and then download it. Upon completion, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 3 – Set high priority for Warcraft 3 Reforged

 Setting a specific application to high priority will make it access more system resources than other running software and thus play smoothly. So, you can boost the priority level for Warcraft 3 Reforged and see how it works.

**1)** Right-click on any empty area on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ta-1-1.jpg)

### Fix 4 – Close background applications

 Warcraft 3 Reforged sometimes fails to work when too many applications are running in the background. They may cause software conflicts or use up system resources. Make sure all unnecessary programs are closed before you start gaming. Here’s how:

**1)** Right-click on any empty area on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ta-1-1.jpg)

**2)** Right-click each resource-hogging application, and then click **End task**  to close them one by one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-2-3.jpg)

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Relaunch Warcraft 3 and test if this method helps. If not, you can go for Fix 5 below.

### Fix 5 – Stop overclocking

 To gain the best performance, many players attempted to overclock their GPUs. However, doing this is sometimes counterproductive and can render your game unstable. We suggest**lowering your GPU to the default settings** to stop Warcraft 3 Reforged from crashing. If the situation isn’t mitigated with this workaround, turn to the next fix below.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1-2.jpg)
