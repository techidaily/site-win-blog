![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/warzone-gpu-0.jpg)

 Released in early 2020, Warzone is still one of the hottest FPS in 2021\. But the game is never problem-free, and many players are still reporting that**the game isn‚Äôt using GPU** . If you‚Äôre on the same boat, don‚Äôt worry. Here‚Äôre some working fixes that can help you get everything back on track.

 Before troubleshooting, you should**try different hardware monitors** to see if it‚Äôs just a false alarm.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try all of them, simply work your way down until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Change settings in your graphics control panel**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Set graphics preference to High performance**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Run Warzone in Windowed mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, Warzone won‚Äôt work properly with your GPU when you‚Äôre using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . So first you need to make sure you have the latest correct graphics driver. The newest driver usually helps improve compatibility and boost in-game performance.

 You can update the GPU driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer‚Äôs websites ([**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), searching your graphics card and downloading the latest correct installer. But if you don‚Äôt like playing with computer drivers, you can update the GPU driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
