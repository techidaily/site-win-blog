## 2\. Disable conflicting processes in the background

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)

 Then try to play your game via Paradox Launcher again and see if its launching problem is fixed. If the problem still remains, please move on to the next fix below.

## 3\. Make sure your Windows is updated

 If your system isnâ€™t updated regularly, there could be missing redistributables and outdated .NET Framework, which are essential to game launchers like Paradox Launcher. Luckily, most of these required files can be downloaded and installed via Windows Update. So you should make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png)
2. Click**Check for updates** , and Windows will scan for any available updates.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-19.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Restart your computer for the update to take effect if needed.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png)

 Then try to play your game via Paradox Launcher again to see if it can launch. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Modify your antivirus program settings

 Windows Defender, or a third-party antivirus program, could mistake your Paradox Launcher as a threat, as it usually consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when a game is running. To make sure that your antivirus program is not the culprit to the Paradox Launcher not working problem, here are two things that you can do:

### 4.1 Add Steam and the game to the antivirus exception list

 Third-party antivirus applications hook very deep into your system, so it may interfere with Steam and Paradox Launcher. To avoid this problem, you can try   **adding both Steam and Paradox Launcher as exceptions to your third-party antivirus application** .

 If youâ€™re not sure how to do it, please consult your antivirus documentation for further instructions.

### 4.2 Make sure bootstrapper-v2.exe is not flagged as a virus

 It was reported by some users that their antivirus program accidentally flagged**bootstrapper-v2.exe** as a virus or PUA (potentially unwanted application), and thus with the Paradox Launcher not working problem.

 In this case, the fix is rather straightforward, just restore bootstrapper-v2.exe from the quarantine section in your anvirus program.

 If Windows Defender is marking this file as a potential threat, you can do the following to restore the file:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**windows security** . Then select**Windows Security** from the list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7.png)
2. Select**Virus & Threat protection** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png)
3. Under**Current threats** , select**Protection history** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-10.png)
4. If you can see**bootstrapper-v2.exe** or other Paradox Launcher-related services and programs here, click the**Actions** button and select**Restore** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11.png)
