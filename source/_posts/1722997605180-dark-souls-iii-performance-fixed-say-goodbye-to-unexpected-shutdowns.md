 to  
**<config><ScreenMode>WINDOWED</ScreenMode>**

 5) Save your change and restart your game.

 Your problem still persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Update your video driver

 Many players have reported that the graphics card driver may be the culprit to the crashing issue, and updating the graphics driver helps resolve the problem. So you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

 You can update your graphics card driver by navigating to graphics manufacturer website, find the latest version for your video card, then download and install it. This requires time and computer skills.

 If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 4: Set game options to LOW

 If your game options are set High, this requires much more system resources and so Dark Souls 3 may crash. In that case, you should set game options to**_LOW_** so as to stop your game crashing.

 Be sure to set the resolution to the same resolution of your monitor. Also set**Effects quality** ,**Shadow quality** , and**Light quality** to**LOW** .

If you can’t access the in-game settings, try this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**_%appdata%_** and press**Enter** .
