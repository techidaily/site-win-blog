## Fix 2: Update graphics driver

 The broken or outdated graphics driver may also be the main culprit behind the game crashing issues.

 As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping) and even screen flickering issues. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date so as to avoid such issues. The latest graphics driver will enhance your graphics card performance and unlock the full potential of your graphics card, which will give you an edge in PC video games.

 If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

Or

 If the latest graphics driver fails to stop the crash, just read on to try the next fix, below.

## Fix 3: Repair corrupted system files

 Windows system file corruption will also lead the game to crash. If you’ve played PC games for years, you may have already known that even a missing or corrupted .dll file (dynamic link libraries) would cause a game to crash.

## Fix 4: Install the latest game patch

 The game developers release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you run the game.

 Run Ghostwire: Tokyo and see if the game crashing issue has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Install the latest DirectX files

 Most games require DirectX 12 to run properly, and Ghostwire: Tokyo is no exception. Ghostwire: Tokyo would crash on startup if there’s a problem with DirectX on your PC.

 If you’re not sure whether there’s something wrong with DirectX on your PC, you can try updating / install the latest DirectX version:

1. Go to[the Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtime Web Install page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .
2. Click the Download button to start the download.  
![download latest DirectX](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-latest-DirectX.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214" border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded**.exe** file to install it on your computer.
4. Restart your computer and launch the game.

 See if Ghostwire: Tokyo crashes again after you installed the latest DirectX file. If this fix didn’t work for you, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Many gamers would like to overclock the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card for a better FPS. However, this approach often crashes the game.

 To reduce the probability of game crashing issues, it’s suggested that you reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

 If you’re using the software like MSI Afterburner, AMD Overdrive, GIGABYTE Easy Tune, etc., you may need to disable them first.

 See this issue persists after you stopped overclocking. If this fix didn’t help, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 7: Disable Steam Overlay

 Overlays are convenient, but sometimes they would interfere with the game and even block the game files, leading to the game crashing issues.

 If you’re using the Steam Overlay while playing the game, try disabling it for Ghostwire: Tokyo:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Ghostwire: Tokyo_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features (e.g. Xbox Game Bar, Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc.), ensure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature.

 Launch Ghostwire: Tokyo and see if the it crashes again. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 8: Disable third-party antivirus software

 Many third-party antivirus software block game files, which may also crash the game. If you have third-party antivirus software running on your computer, make sure it doesn’t block the game files.

 You can try adding both the game folder and the Steam client as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, try**temporarily disabling your third-party antivirus software** before you play the game.

 See if the game crashes after you added it as an exception to your antivirus software. If none of the fixes above works, try reinstalling the game. Normally, after reinstalling the game, you’ll be able to fix the crashing issue.
