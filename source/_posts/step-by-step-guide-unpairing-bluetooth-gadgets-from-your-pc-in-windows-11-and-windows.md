##  Remove Bluetooth Devices Using the Settings App

 A quick way to remove paired Bluetooth devices is by using Windows’ Settings app, though it is a little different in Windows 10 and Windows 11.

 If your device installed certain drivers, Settings won’t remove them. In this case, use the Device Manager method below. If you're unsure what method to use, stick to this one.

###  On Windows 11

 Launch the Settings app by pressing Windows+i. In the left sidebar, select "Bluetooth & Devices." On the right pane, choose "Devices."

##  Remove Bluetooth Devices Using Command Prompt

 If you prefer using command line methods over graphical ones, you can use a command in Command Prompt (or PowerShell) to remove the paired Bluetooth devices from your PC. This method achieves the same result as the graphical methods above.

 To use this method, you’ll first find your device’s instance path. The command that deletes the devices requires this path to identify your device. To find it, open Device Manager by pressing Windows+X and choosing "Device Manager."

 Expand "Bluetooth," right-click the device you want to delete, and select "Properties."

!['Properties' highlighted for a Bluetooth device in Device Manager.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10-bluetooth-device-properties.jpg) 

 On the Properties window, open the "Details" tab. Click the "Property" drop-down menu and select "Device Instance Path." This is the second option in the menu.

 Right-click the text displayed in the "Value" field and select "Copy."

!['Details,' 'Property,' and 'Copy' highlighted on the 'Properties' window.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/11-copy-bluetooth-device-instance-path.jpg) 

 Close Device Manager. Open the Start Menu, search for "Command Prompt", and select "Run as Administrator."

 In the User Account Control (UAC) prompt, select "Yes."

 On the Command Prompt window, type the following command, replacing "DEVICE\_ID" with the value you copied. Enclose the pasted value in double quotes.

 Then, press Enter.

 Make sure to enter the correct device instance path in the command, or you’ll accidentally end up removing a device you didn’t want to delete.

pnputil /remove-device “DEVICE_ID”
