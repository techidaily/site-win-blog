1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to open **Windows Settings** . Then click **Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/update1.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** . Windows will start searching for available updates. If there are updates available, Windows will automatically download and install the updates.  
![Check for updates Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Check-for-updates-Windows-10.jpg)

 If there are no updates related to MS Visual C++, you can download its installation files via the links below on your own and manually install them on your PC.

* [Visual C++ Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0)

 Restart your PC after you installed the Visual C++ Redistributables. Then run F1 2021 and see if the game crashes. If not, congratulations, you’ve resolved this issue! If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Some 3rd party antivirus software would block the game files, which may also lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Run F1 2021 and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.
