1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke Settings. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working1.jpg)
2. Scroll down and click**Microphone** . Click the**Change** button, then make sure the**Microphone for this device** is toggled**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working7.jpg)
3. Check if**Allow apps to access your microphone** is**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working8.jpg)

 Try to use the microphone on OBS again to see if it works. If not, move on to have another try.

## Fix 4 Modify audio settings on OBS

 The Push-To-Talk (Aka PTT) function on OBS allows you to record your voice only if you hold the PTT hotkey. Therefore, if you turn on Push-To-Talk unconsciously, it may seem OBS fails to capture your voice when you start recording with the mouse. So open OBS to modify it:

1. Click**Settings** on the bottom-right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working20.jpg)
2. Click**Audio** on the left tab. Locate and uncheck**Enable Push-to-talk** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working21.jpg)
3. Click**Hotkeys** on the left tab. Scroll down to locate Push-to-talk. If it’s displaying a key,**delete** it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/obs-mic-not-working19.jpg)
4. Click**Apply** and**OK** on the bottom-right corner.

Use your microphone to check whether the problem is solved.
