Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
