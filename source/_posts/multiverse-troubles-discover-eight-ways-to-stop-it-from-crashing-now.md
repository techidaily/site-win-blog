### Fix 1: Check for game updates and server issues

 We recommend you start by checking for available game updates, because any pending updates might contain patches for the current bugs or glitches. Another choice is to check for any server issues from the game’s social media like **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/multiversus)**  . The developer will post info there about recent updates or server issues, which help you identify the trigger for crashing.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/multiversus-twitter-2.jpg)

 Tony Huynh is the Game Director of MultiVersus.

 When server issues happen, just wait until they solve these problems. For any pending game updates, install them immediately and see if the game still crashes.

Nothing wrong with the game? Simply move on to the following fixes.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes tend to be graphics-related. Any faulty or outdated graphics driver will probably trigger MultiVersus crashing. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date, so as to avoid issues like crashing – an optimization of your game experience. Here’re two ways to do it:

#### Option 1 – Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 First, identify the manufacturer of your graphics card, and download drivers from their support page:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Search for the latest one that’s compatible with your operating system, then manually download and install it. After that, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/de-scan-now-11.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/update-all-graphics.jpg)  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the **[free version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 When everything is set, restart your PC and the game to see if the problem persists. If so, try the fixes below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Remove all game modifications

 MultiVersus recently banned any in-game modification(mod). And they’ve confirmed that some user-reported crashing is triggered by mods. So if you’re still using them, MultiVersus might crash.

Simply remove all game mods and see if the issue disappears.

1. Navigate to the installation folder for the game. If you downloaded it from Steam, the default location is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\MultiVersus\\MultiVersus. Then click**Content** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/multiversus-folder-content-1.jpg)
2. Then click the**Paks** folder.

### Fix 4: Improve your Internet connection

 Game-playing requires a stable Internet. If the Internet is slow on your end, the game might crash. So you should make sure the Internet is working properly while playing. To optimize the connection:

#### Option 1 – Restart your router

Try restarting your router to refresh your Internet connection.

1. Unplug the router from the power outlet, and wait for at least 15 seconds.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/router-pixabay.jpg)
2. Plug it back in and test your Internet connection.

 Outdated or missing WiFi drivers can also lead to on-and-off Internet connection. Try **[Diver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically download and install all the drivers you need.

#### Option 2 – Disable VPN

 If your VPN-enabled link connects to a server in a country that does not have support for MultiVersus, you might encounter the EU4 fatal error issue, a type of crashing. Disable your VPN entirely to see if the problem lingers on.

#### Option 3 – Close resource-consuming apps

 Use Task Manager to close any apps that are competing for bandwidth and consuming much CPU and memory. To close them:

1. On your Taskbar, right-click and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/taskbar-task-manager.jpg)
2. Right-click the app that you don’t need, then click**End task** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Relaunch your game and see if it still crashes. If so, move on to the following fixes.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 According to some gamers, Windows updates fixed their crashing issue. So if you haven’t updated for a while, it’s time to do so. Here’s how to do it:

1. In the search box on your screen, type**updates** and click**Open** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/search-box-updates.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** to see if there are available updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Hold on until the updating procedure completes. Then restart your computer, relaunch the game, and check if the crashing is fixed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Verify the integrity of your game files

 The game might crash when some game files are missing or corrupted. If you’re not sure whether there are corrupted game files, just follow the steps below to verify the game files on Steam:

1. Open Steam, navigate to**LIBRARY** , and find MultiVersus.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/multiversus-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click it and select**Properties…**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/multiversus-properties.jpg)
3. Select**LOCAL FILES** and click**Verify integrity of game files…**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/multiversus-local-files.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 When the verifying finishes, launch MultiVersus again to see if it still crashes. If this issue persists, try the next fix.

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 One potential trigger of crashing is that other programs are conflicting with MultiVersus. You can perform a clean boot to weed out the offender. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** to invoke the Run box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![run msconfig](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/run-msconfig.png)
2. Navigate to the**Services** tab and enable the**Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/msconfig-hide-all-microsoft-services-clean-boot.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT for those belong to your graphics card or sound card manufacturer, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA**  and **Intel** . Then click **OK** .

5. One at a time, select any programs with high Startup impact, and click **Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup-disable-startup-program.jpg)

 Restart your PC and launch MultiVersus again. If the game still crashes, repeat the steps above and disable another program.

### Fix 8: Reinstall the game

 MultiVersus might crash when it’s not installed correctly. If none of the fixes above work for you, try reinstalling the game altogether. Here is how to do it on Steam：

1. Open Steam and find MultiVersus under**LIBRARY** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/multiversus-steam.jpg)
