## Troubleshooting and Fixing High CPU Use on Google Chrome - Solutions Unveiled

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bebfc398cd6b.jpg)

 While you’re browsing the Internet on your computer, your system starts freezing for a few seconds, then resumes normally and then again freezes. When you open Task Manager, it shows Google Chrome using a high percentage of your CPU. You may wonder how come Chrome is eating so much of your CPU — there’re many possible causes for Chrome high CPU usage, but there are also many possible solutions…

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 solutions that have helped many other users fix their Chrome high CPU usage problem. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Free up drive space](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Disable unnecessary extensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Reset Chrome settings to default](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Uninstall Chrome, delete its installation folder and reinstall Chrome](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Free up drive space

 If your C: drive is less than 2 GB, freeing space would help drop the CPU usage. As soon as the free space is more than 2 GB, you’ll see the difference. Click to learn[how to free up drive space](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
 This is also the reason why clearing disk cache and cookies would work.  
 Here’s how to clear cache and cookies in Chrome:

1. Open Chrome, and then press**Ctrl + Shift + Del** on your keyboard.
2. From the**Basic** tab, set the**Time range** to**All time** , and select all the checkboxes below.![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chrome-Clear-cache1.jpg)
3. From the**Advanced** tab, set the**Time range** to**All time** . Select the types of information you want to remove. Make sure **Cookies and other site data** ,**Cache images and files** are selected.![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chrome-Clear-cache-2.jpg)
4. Click**Clear data** .
5. When the data is cleared, type**chrome://restart** in the URL bar then press**Enter** to restart Chrome.

### Fix 2: Disable unnecessary extensions

 Chrome extensions are also known to cause Chrome high system resource usage, such as 100% CPU, memory or disk usage. If you’ve installed a number of Chrome extensions, they may be the culprit for Chrome high CPU usage. We recommend disabling or deleting them one by one. Then restart Chrome and see if Chrome high CPU usage is fixed.

1. Type`**chrome://extensions**` in the URL bar and press**Enter** to open the Chrome extension manager, where Chrome extensions are installed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bece0cbe3af4.png)
2. **Toggle off** all extensions to disable them.

3. Restart Chrome and test if the issue is fixed. If not, move on to Solution 3, below.

### Fix 3: Reset Chrome settings to default

 Resetting Chrome to its default settings is another useful solution to Chrome high CPU usage. This rules out all man-made causes. You can follow these steps to reset Chrome settings to default:

1. At the top right in Chrome, click the**three dots** \>**Settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chrome-setting-reset.jpg)
2. Select **Reset settings** on the left, and then click **Restore settings to their original defaults** on the right.
