## Solving the Mute Mystery in 'Evil Genius 2': A Step-by-Step Guide to Get Volume Back

It’s annoying that the game doesn’t start up with sound, or can’t get any sound. If you have the same issue, this post may help.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Use wire headsets](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Install Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Use wire headsets

 Some players have found out the game need to use a 3.5mm jack to bypass the headsets audio. Therefore, use a wired input instead of USB headphones. USB headphones are not working well with Evil Genius 2.

Hope it works for you, if not, try updating your audio driver.
