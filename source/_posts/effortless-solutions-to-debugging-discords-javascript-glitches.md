### Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the system requirements for DayZ

 DayZ crashing issue often occurs when the specs of your PC fails to meet the system requirements for DayZ. Before trying other fixes, you should make sure your PC meet the minimum system requirements for the game.

Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**  | Intel Core i5-4430                    |
| **Memory:**     | 8 GB RAM                              |
| **Graphics:**   | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X |
| **DirectX:**    | Version 11                            |
| **Storage:**    | 16 GB available space                 |
| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

#### The recommended system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 10 64-bit                     |

| **Processor:**  | Intel Core i5-6600K or AMD R5 1600X   |

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

 If your PC fails to meet DayZ minimum system requirements, you may not be able to run the game properly on your PC. In such a case, you need to **upgrade your hardware first** .

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of the game

 Corrupted game files may also crash the game. To fix this issue, you need to verify the game files. Here is how to do it:

1. Open the Steam client and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** , then **right-click** on**DayZ** and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-verify-the-game-file-1.png)
2. Click **the LOCAL FILES tab** , then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE…** . After that, click **CLOSE** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-verify-the-game-file-2.png)

 Launch DayZ after verifying the game file to see if this fix works. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 5: Turn off Steam Overlay

1. In Steam, click the**Steam** tab on the upper left corner and select**Settings** to open the Settings page of the Steam client.

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat. You can try   **adding DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 See if you can run DayZ without crashes. If not, try the next fix below to reinstall the game.
