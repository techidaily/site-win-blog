## How to Stop 'Stray: Impact' Game From Crashing on Your PC – Effective Fixes Revealed

The Stray is a hit in July. As a cat lover, I’m obsessed with the game, however, the game crashing, freezing, and not launching is pushing me away. We just wanna run around like a cat. It’s common to see crashings when a game is newly released, except waiting for a new patch, there’s something we can try to fix the game issue.

## Try these fixes

 Try restarting your PC first, if that doesn’t help, just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Put commands in the launch option](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Open Oculus app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your graphic driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Download and install file from Github](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 3: Open Oculus app

 Still facing the problem? If you have the Oculus app installed on your PC, launch this app and the crashing will be fixed. We don’t know why, but it did work for many players.

1. Type oculus on the search bar.
2. Open the Oculus app.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/oculus-app.jpg)
3. Back to Steam and click**Play** to launch Stray.
4. You should be able to play the game.

 If you don’t have the Oculus app or it doesn’t work for you, move to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphic driver

 Updating your graphics driver would help you fix the Stray crashing issue. There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually. To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 6: Lower graphic settings

 Some gamers reported lowering the graphics settings in the Stray would fix the random game crashing on Stray.

 To do so, you need to cap FPS at 60FPS and turn on Vsync, setting graphics settings to the lowest options. Then back to the game and see if it fixes your problem.

 That’s all about how to fix Stray crashing on the startup, Stray fatal error and UE4 engine crashing issue. If none of the fixes work for you, you can contact Stray developer team or wait for a new patch.
