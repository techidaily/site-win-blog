## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Halo 3 is no exception. To enjoy smooth gameplay, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how to update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer and launch Halo3 to check if the issue is fixed. If not, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 Your game might suddenly close without giving you any error message. If you’re experiencing this kind of issue even after updating the graphics drivers, then we suggest you try performing Clean Boot. It can be a great way to troubleshoot the Halo 3 crashing issues.

To do so:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

 2) Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

## Fix 5: Run Halo 3 as an administrator

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above and still haven’t resolved the Halo 3 crashing issue, then you should try running the game as an administrator.

 1) Right-click the**Halo 3** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)
  
 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab and click**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**Apply** and**OK** .  
  
![run as administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-compatability.jpg)
  
 3) Go to the directory where you installed Halo 3, and run the**.exe** file as administrator as well.  
  
 4) Relaunch Halo 3.  
  
 If the problem still persists, then try the next fix.

---

## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Right-click**Halo 3** and select**Properties** .
