 Upon restart, launch your game and check if this works for you. If the error message still pops up, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Update your drivers

 After you’ve confirmed the integrity of your game files is intact and you have the latest Windows version, it’s time you check if your drivers,**especially your graphics driver** , are up-to-date. Using outdated drivers can cause a wide variety of issues with your programs. Therefore, you should check if there are any driver updates available.

 To update your drivers, you can either do it automatically by going to the Device Manager or directly head to the manufacturers’ official websites to download and install the correct drivers for your system. This is obviously time-consuming. If you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers on your own, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , an automatic driver updater tool to help you automatically detect the outdated drivers, download and install the driver updates.

## 4\. Disable background applications

 If you’re experiencing launching problems when using Rockstar Games Launcher, it could be due to a third-party application running in the background. In this situation, you can disable applications running in the background by following the instructions below.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R**  keys simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **taskmgr** and press Enter.

 Then relaunch your game. If this doesn’t do the trick, move on to the next fix.

## 5\. Run the launcher as administrator

 If your game fails to launch properly, it could be due to the lack of administrative rights. To fix it, try to run the Rockstar Games Launcher as an administrator by following the instructions below.

1. From your desktop, right-click on the Rockstar Games Launcher icon and select**Properties** .  

![run Rockstar Games Launcher with compatibility mode with administrator priviledges](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/select-Properties.png)
2. In the Properties window, select the**Compatibility** tab. Then check the box next to**Run the program as an administrator** .  

![rockstar games launcher run as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/run-as-administrator.png)

 Then click**Apply > OK** to save the changes.

 If your problem persists, don’t worry. Below are some other fixes you can try.

## 6\. Delete the Rockstar Games folders

 If none of the fixes listed above help, you should try deleting the Social Club folder from**Program Files** and**Program Files (x86)** . It’s usually located on**C:\\Program Files\\Rockstar Games** and**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rockstar Games** .
