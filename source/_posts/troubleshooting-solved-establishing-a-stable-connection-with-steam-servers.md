 5) Restart your computer after the uninstall of both of your video card driver and your sound card driver.

## 4: Disable or uninstall third-party antivirus programs

 If you’ve installed antivirus or anti-malware programs such as Norton, Kaspersky, AVG, Avast Behavior Shield or Malwarebytes, you should **temporarily**   turn them off or disable them to see if they’re causing your Start menu not working problem. If your computer’s Start menu returns to normal when they’re off, you should contact the vendor of the software to see if they can provide some help.

 Note that Microsoft has its own default anti-malware, **Windows Defender** . It’s automatically enabled even if you also have other antivirus applications installed. Even if you disable your other antivirus programs, Windows Defender is always there for you during that certain time range. So, no need to worry too much about temporarily turning antivirus off.

 6: Run Microsoft Start menu troubleshooter

 Clearly, Microsoft has recognized the Start menu not working problem after the Creators update, therefore they have rolled out the [**Microsoft Start menu troubleshooter**](http://aka.ms/diag%5FStartMenu) for you to try.

 It will check if the Start Menu and Cortana are installed correctly, and whether registry key permissions and database corruptions are in place and more stuff like these.

 Install this troubleshooter and see if your problem can be fixed by it. If the problem remains, you should move on to the methods coming up next.

 7: Check and repair Windows files

 1) Right-click the task bar on your desktop at the bottom and click **Task Manager** .

 If the result you see is the same with the screen shot above, your system files are all right, and you should move on and run another test. 5) Copy and paste the following command in, and press the Enter key on your keyboard. Still, it could take a while, wait with patience.
