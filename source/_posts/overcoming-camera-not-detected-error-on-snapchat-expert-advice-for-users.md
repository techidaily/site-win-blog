### Fix 1: Remove periphery devices

 This should be the first thing to do when problems occur. This is the easiest way to check whether external devices conflict with Windows Updating Process. By removing all periphery hardware components except for the mouse and keyboard, we’ll know whether it’s a hardware issue.

 If this does sort out the issue, try plugging back each device one by one. In this way, you can recognize which device causes the problem.

 If it’s not sorting out the issue, let’s head to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 If you’re an HP user, you need to update your Conexant drivers. But the newer version can’t be found on the HP drivers page neither in Device Manager. So follow the steps below and you can update to 20H2 successfully.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct and the latest drivers for it.
2. Run[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-Geoforce.jpg)
4. Reboot your PC and run the Windows Update again. You should be able to finish the feature upgrade to 20H2.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 If you don’t want to download Driver Easy, you can uninstall Conexant audio driver instead. By the way, if you have HP Dock Audio, uninstall it as well.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
6. Reboot your PC and run Windows Update again. You should be able to finish the feature upgrade to 20H2.

### Fix 3: Disable antivirus

 The third-party antivirus software is installed to protect our PC from malware attacks, but sometimes they could be the culprit for PC errors.

 During the Windows updating process, the third-party antivirus could interfere and block the new files which can cause the Windows Update error code 0xc19001e1.

 Therefore, disable the antivirus software then restart your PC to apply the change. Update your Windows system and see if it fixes the issue.

Don’t forget to enable the software afterward.

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Repair system files

 One of the reasons that cause the Windows Update Error 0xc19001e1 is corrupted system files.

Here’s how to fix it:

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-error-0xc19001e1-in-windows-10/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.

### Fix 6: Free up disk space

 When there’s no enough space on your disc for the installation of the update, you might receive error code 0xc19001e1\. So you need to ensure you have enough space. If you don’t have, deleting junk and duplicate files to free up some space.

1. Press**Windows logo key + I** together on your keyboard. Then click**System** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-on-System.jpg)
2. Click**Storage** on the left panel and you can view the storage usage of your computer.

If you want to reduce the amount of space being used:

1. Click the**left arrow** in the upper left corner of the window to go back to the storage settings.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f0094a368f.jpg)

2. Click_the disk you’re going to clean up_ .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f021078a01.jpg)
3. Check the space usage of_each data type_ . If you want to manage the usage of a type,**click it** to view more details.  
\* The following are a few things we recommend you take a look at:  
   * **The data type that uses the most amount of space**  
   * **Apps & Games** to see if there are any program installed you don’t need  
   * **Temporary files**  
   * **Desktop**

 This should free up a lot of space for your Windows 10 computer. Reboot your PC and update your system.

### Fix 7: Reset or reinstall Windows

 If all else fails, you may have to[reset Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , or maybe even[reinstall it](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) together.

 But treat these options as a last resort, because they both take quite a long time.
