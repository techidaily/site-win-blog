## Fix 1: Verify the game files

 The first thing you can do is to verify Super People game files. Steam will help you scan and repair any missing or corrupted game files. Here’s how:

1. Find Super People CBT in your Steam library and right-click it. Click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Steam-right-click-Properties.jpg)
2. Under the**Local files** tab, click**Verify integrity of game files** .

3. It may take a while for Steam to finish the process. When it’s done, restart the Steam client and launch the game.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game crashing issues is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. Sometimes Windows isn’t able to provide the latest available update, so you’ll need to go to the manufacturer’s website. Search for the latest correct driver and be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC and run Super People. If updating the graphics driver doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Check for conflicting programs

 Super People may crash when background programs are conflicting with it. You can close any unnecessary programs first to see if the problem goes away.

 If the game still crashes, you may need to check your antivirus software (if you use any.) Aggressive antivirus software can cause interference and cause the game to crash. You can add the game to the whitelist/exception list of the antivirus software.

 If you don’t use any third-party antivirus tool or you’re sure it’s not the cause, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Repair your system files

 In addition to game files, corrupted system files may also cause the game to crash. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system issues, but it could miss minor issues and most of the time, manual repair is required.

 To use a more powerful tool to repair your system, we recommend giving **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) a try. It’s a professional system repair software that specializes in solving program and security issues found on your PC. Fortect can also diagnose your Windows problems and fix corrupted system files and services without affecting your data.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Run the software. Fortect will start a deep scan of your system. The process may take a while.
3. Once the scan is complete, you can review the summary. If Fortect detects any missing or broken system files or other issues that may have caused Super People to crash, you can click **Start Repair** to fix them.

## Fix 5: Disable overlays

 In-game overlays like in Steam or Discord are handy, but some reports say the overlays can cause Super People to crash. Some players have solved the crashing issue by disabling the overlays, so it’s definitely worth trying.

 Below we’ll show how to disable the overlay feature on Steam and Discord as examples. You can also try to turn off the overlay of any other program if you think it may have caused the crashing issue.

#### Steam

1. Launch Steam, and navigate to **Settings >> In-game** .
2. **Uncheck the box of Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-07_14-56-20.jpg)
3. Click **OK** to save the changes.

 You can also disable Steam overlay only for Super People, if your other games run just fine. Here’s how:

1. In your Steam library, right-click Super People CBT and click **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Steam-right-click-Properties.jpg)
2. Under the **General tab** , make sure **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game is unchecked** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-07_14-59-03.jpg)

#### Discord

1. Launch Discord. On the bottom-left, click the **gear-shaped icon** to open the user settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-05_15-52-40.jpg)
2. On the left panel, scroll down and find **Game Overlay** . Toggle off **Enable in-game overlay** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-11-05_15-53-25.jpg)

If disabling in-game overlays doesn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Keep your system up-to-date

 Another quick but effective fix is to install the latest Windows updates. You want to make sure your system is up-to-date so any known system bugs are fixed. It may also solve compatibility issues with programs on your PC, especially like a new game in the beta stage like Super People, and help with the crashing issue.

 Here’s how to check for Windows updates and install the available ones:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type **update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for available system updates. If there are _no_  available updates, you’ll get a **You’re up to date** sign. You could also click **View all optional updates** and install them if needed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation if needed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-update.jpg)
4. You will be prompted to restart your PC. Make sure you save important files in advance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 When Windows is writing data into the drive, it could interfere with the gameplay. So make sure Super People is not running while Windows is installing the updates in the background.  
  
 If you’ve allowed Windows to automatically install the system updates for you, make sure you double-check the Windows Update is not running in the background while you’re playing the game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Restore MSVCP140\_1.dll

 You may see the error message “MSVCP140\_1.dll was not found” when Super People crashes on your PC. To fix this issue, you need to download the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packs.

 Go to[Microsoft official download page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) and download the corresponding file for X64 version. Once the download is complete, run the executable file and follow on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

 X64 is for 64-bit and X84 is for 32-bit. If your PC is a 32-bit version, you won’t be able to run Super People since it’s not supported.

## Fix 8: Reinstall Super People

 If the fixes above didn’t solve your problem, you can try to reinstall the entire game. This may help if the previous installation was somehow interrupted and caused the random crashes.
