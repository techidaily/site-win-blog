### Fix 1: Check your system specs

 If your game won’t launch at all, chances are that you’re running a game that stretches your PC beyond its abilities.

 You should verify that your system meets the minimum system requirements to run the game. If your PC below the recommended spec,   **try lowering your resolution and graphics and in-game video settings** .

 Here are the **minimum**  system requirements to play_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **DirectX** :      | Version 12                      |
| **Memory** :       | 8GB RAM                         |
| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i3-4170 or higher    |
| **Graphics card:** | Nvidia GTX 650Ti or AMD R7 250X |
| **Storage** :      | 70GB available space            |

 Here are the**recommended** system requirements to run_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit              |

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver
