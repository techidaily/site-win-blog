 The black screen issue usually relates to the PC’s graphics card and graphics driver. If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, there might be crashes, black screen, lags and etc.

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD constantly release new drivers to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. Therefore, updating your driver would be the fix for many issues.

There are two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Edit the configure file might be a solution for some players. We highly recommend you**back up the file** you’re about to edit so that you can restore it when there’re certain issues appear.
