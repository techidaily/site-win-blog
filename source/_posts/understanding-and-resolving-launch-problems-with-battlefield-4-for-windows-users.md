### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

To fix the potential problems and enjoy maximum gaming performance, you need to make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit your graphics card’s official website ( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
