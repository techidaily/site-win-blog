## Maximize Your Horizon Zero Dawn Adventure with Optimal FPS Enhancement Techniques

Looking for solutions to optimize Horizon Zero Dawn? This post is here to help you boot FPS, reduce lag, stop stuttering, fix spikes and improve visuals within Horizon Zero Dawn.

## Before starting

* Make sure you have enough space in your disk drive
* Make sure your Windows Game Mode/Xbox Game Bar/Captures is off
* Make sure disable all the overlays
* Make sure Windows Graphic Settings is on
* Meet the minimum system requirements

#### Minimum system requirements

| **OS**        | Windows 10 64-bits                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Intel Core <i5-2500K@3.3GHz> or AMD FX <6300@3.5GHz>         |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                                                 |
| **Graphics**  | Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 (3 GB) or AMD Radeon R9 290 (4GB) |
| **DirectX**   | Version 12                                               |
| **Storage**   | 100 GB available space                                   |

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Change in-game settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Set as priority](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update graphic driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Install Windows Updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Change in-game settings

 Changing in-game Display settings will reduce GPU and CPU load to fix spikes and improve visuals in game.

| Settings                 | Recommend   |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Display resolution       | 1920 x 1080 |
| Field of View            | 90          |
| Adaptive performance FPS | Off         |
| V-sync                   | Off         |

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2: Set as priority

 If you’re sure your graphics card isn’t under much load, then changing the game priority to see the difference. Make sure you’ve closed other programs running on the background.

1. Press the **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open **Task Manager** .
2. Go to the **Details** tab and find Horizon Zero Dawn.
3. Right-click on it and select **Set priority > Realtime** or **High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_16-56-17.jpg)
4. Reboot the game and change Game Settings to **Windowed Full-Screen** mode.
5. Check the FPS.

If it’s not working, move to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update graphic driver

 The graphic card and graphic drivers are closely bound with FPS and visuals in game. The game couldn’t run smoothly without correct and up-to-date drivers. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updated to improve your gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-horizon-zero-dawn-boost-fps-and-increase-performance/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
