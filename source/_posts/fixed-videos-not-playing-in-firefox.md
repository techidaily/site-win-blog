### Fix 3: Update your drivers

 Missing or outdated drivers on your computer may also cause Firefox to crash. You can try updating the device drivers on your PC to better troubleshoot the problem.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** — You can update your device drivers manually by going to the device manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact device model and your version of Windows.

**Automatic driver update** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update all your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.
