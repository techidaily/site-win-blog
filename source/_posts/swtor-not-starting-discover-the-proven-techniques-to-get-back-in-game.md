Here is how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and type **game bar settings** . Then click **Game bar settings** as it shows up as a search result.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-132.png)

 2) In **Game bar** , toggle **off** the switch for **Record game clips, screenshots,broadcast using Game bar** .

5) Exit the window.

6) Run Gears of War 5 to see if the crashing issue still happens. If no, then you’ve solved the issue! If yes – the crashing issue still occurs, please move on to **Fix 3** , below.

**If you have other game overlaying programs on** , such as Nvidia Shadowplay, Xbox game bar, please make sure you have turned them off as well.

### Fix 3:   **Reset the Microsoft Store cache**

 Overtime, Windows caches downloads made through Windows Store. This can take up a lot of space and cause problems when downloads come to a halt. So you can reset the Microsoft Store cache to fix problems like this and see if it solves the Gear 5 crashes issue.

Here is how to reset the Microsoft Store cache:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-logo-key-5.png) and type **R** at the same time, then type **wsreset.exe** and press **Enter** .

### Fix 5: Update DirectX

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards. If you’re running an old version of DirectX, it’s possible that it won’t be able to handle the graphics rendering and processing task, which might cause the Gears of War to crash. So you should update DirectX to the latest version to see if it fixes the issue.

 If you’re not sure which version of DirectX your computer is running, or how to update DirectX, please refer to this **[quick guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Once you’ve updated DirectX, check to see if the game crashes issue is fixed.

 Still not resolved? Please try **Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Reinstall the game

 If the above steps didn’t , then it’s time to reinstall the game to see if it works. To do so, simply uninstall the game from your PC, then head to Microsoft Store, search the game, download and install it.

 Once you’ve reinstalled Gears of War 5 on your PC, run it to see if it still crashes.

### Fix 7: Disable your X-Fi sound card (If you have an X-Fi sound card)

 According to game forums, many players reported that disabling their X-Fi sound card helped them fix the problem. So if you are also having an X-Fi sound card, you should also give it a try to see if it does the trick.
