### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 The most common cause of Escape from Tarkov FPS drops is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. GPU manufacturers keep optimizing their drivers for the latest titles. So we recommend you check for the driver update regularly to ensure smooth gameplay.

 You could update the graphics driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ) and searching for the driver that’s right for your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan** **Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update** **All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update** **All** ). Or you can click**Update** to update the graphics driver for free, but it’s partly manual.

 Normally you should see a significant performance improvement after you update all the device drivers on your computer. But if not, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close unnecessary background programs

 If you’ve launched several programs such as Chrome or Discord while you’re playing Escape from Tarkov, they will consume your system resources and thus your game renders in low FPS. Before gaming, try to shut down all the unnecessary programs running in the background.

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-1.jpg)
2. Right-click a program and click**End task** to close them one by one.

 If no programs are consuming your CPU or GPU but FPS drops reoccur, try the third fix.

### Fix 4 – Disable fullscreen optimizations

1. Go to the game directory of Escape from Tarkov.
2. Right-click the**EscapeFromTarkov.exe file** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-fullscreen-optimizations-0.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab and tick**Disable full-screen optimisations** . Then, click**Change high DPI settings** .

### Fix 5 – Adjust the in-game graphics settings

1. Launch Escape from Tarkov and click the**gear icon** at the bottom right corner to enter the Settings menu.
2. On the**GRAPHICS** tab,**turn off VSync** . Then set the_Texture quality_ to high and_Shadows quality_ to**low** or**medium** .
