You can just go to the[Elden Ring official twitter](https://twitter.com/ELDENRING) to see if it announces a server maintenance. If there is an announcement about server maintenance, you can wait until the server status is normal.

1. Type**test internet speed** in your browser.
2. Choose a search result to run a speed test.

 If your internet speed is too low, you can try to[speed up the internet](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or just call your ISP.

### Method 1: Optimize Elden Ring’s network settings

 If your Elden Ring’s network is not set correctly, you may find your Elden Ring multiplayer cannot work. To solve this problem, you should check your Elden Ring’s network settings and try to optimize it.

 After you optimize the Elden Ring’s network settings, you can check if it works. If not, move to the next method.

### Method 2: Update your network drivers

 Through network drivers, your PC can connect to the network. If your network driver is outdated, your network connection may become poor and therefore influencing your gaming experience. Once you find your Elden Ring multiplayer can not work, you can try to update your network drivers to the latest version.

Here are two ways to update your network drivers.

#### **Option 1- Manually download and install the driver**

 You can update your network drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. It will take time and effort.

#### **Option 2- Automatically update the driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running on, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any drivers that need to update.  
![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/scan-now-9-available.jpg)
1. You can choose to update the driver with a FREE version. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.
