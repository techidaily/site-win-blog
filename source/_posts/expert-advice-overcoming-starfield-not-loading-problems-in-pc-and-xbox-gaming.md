 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your issue persists, move on to the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Run your game as an administrator

 By default, Windows runs programs as a user, with limited access to the files and folders on your PC. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running your game as an administrator. Here is how:

**1)** Right-click the **Epic Games icon** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-02.jpg)

**2)**  Go to the **Compatibility tab** , then check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-25_10-50-12.jpg)

**3)**  Click **Apply** , then **OK** .

### Fix 3: Turn off unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time during gameplay, your PC might get overloaded and crash your game. Or, in some cases, one of your programs is conflicting with your game and causes it to fail.

 So, it’s recommended that you close unneeded programs while gaming. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Right-click**your taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .

**3)** Relaunch your game to see if this fixed your issue.

If it didn’t, read on and try the fix below.

### Fix 4: Verify your game files
