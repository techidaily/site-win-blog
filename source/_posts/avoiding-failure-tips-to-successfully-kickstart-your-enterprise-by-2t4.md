## Fix 1: Update your driver

 I believe you would be familiar with this warning message after a couple of hours of playing. Some players wonâ€™t be affected, but for others, this warning message points out the reason for the game not launching or crashing issue.

Tips: You can disable the alert in the launcher settings.

 **The solution is easy: update your driver â€“ but not through Windows Update & Device Manager.**

 Thereâ€™re**3 working ways** to update your driver to resolve the issue:

#### 1\. Through manufacturerâ€™s app

 Some graphic card manufacturers provide apps to update their driver easily. Take NVIDIA for example, you can download the[NVIDIA GeForce experience app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update your NVIDIA drivers easily and quickly.

#### 2\. Through manufacturerâ€™s official website

 If you donâ€™t have such an app, you can go to the manufacturerâ€™s official website and download the latest driver ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), then install it manually.

#### 3\. Through Driver Easy

 If you donâ€™t have the time to dig around on the internet, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

If this fix doesnâ€™t help, move to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Launch with Vulkan

 Thereâ€™s an easy fix that would help you run the game â€”**Launching the game with Vulkan instead of DX12** .

 If youâ€™re not launching from Steam, the game should open a menu for you to select how to play the game (Vulkan or DX12).  
 Choose**Vulkan** and launch the game to check.

If youâ€™re launching from Steam, move to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Verify game file

 If you launch the game from Steam, then you try to verify game files. This fix will let Steam check your local files. If thereâ€™re corrupted files, Steam will redownload them and replace them on your local install.

1. Launch Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click on the game and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_17-10-14.png)
3. Go to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**Verify integrity of game filesâ€¦**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/verify.png)
4. Reboot the game when the process is finished.

If this fix is not working, move to the next one.

## Fix 4: Replace the launcher file

 Except for not launching, some players reported they canâ€™t start the game when running on Proton and Manjaro. Replacing the launcher file may work for you.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type**%appdata%** and press the**Enter** key.
