## Update your graphics driver

 You can update manually: first go to the manufacturer’s download page ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), then search your model and download the correct driver installer.

## Install the latest ELEX II patch

 The developer of ELEX II releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance.

 It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it. If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run**ELEX II** again and check if the game crashes get fixed. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Disable overlays

 Overlays sometimes the overlay would interfere with the game and even block the game files. If you’re using the Steam Overlay while playing the game, try disabling Steam Overlay for ELEX II and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _ELEX II_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features (e.g. Xbox Game Bar, Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc.), make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature.

 Run ELEX II and check if the it crashes again. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 3rd party antivirus software sometimes may block game files, which would also crash the game.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable the 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch ELEX II and see if the game crashes after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix, below.
