### Method 4: Copy the steamui.dll file from a friends’s PC

 If unfortunately, all the previous methods fails to help, you can copy the steamui.dll file from a PC that runs the same Windows system as yours.

**Part 1:**   Check your Windows system type and find a computer that runs the same system with yours.

Here’s how you can check Windows type of a computer:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**   to bring up the Search box.
2. Type **system information**   and then select **System Information**   from the result.

3. You should then see the system type of the computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Part 2:**  Copy the steamui.dll file from the working computer and then paste it to the problem computer.

Here’s how you can find the dll file:

1. On the keyboard of the working computer, press the **Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time to bring up the File Explorer.
2. Go to **C:WindowsSystem32** , then type **steamui.dll**  and press **Enter** . If it shows no results, go to **C:WindowsSysWOW64**  instead and search **steamui.dll** again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc561b04adb9.jpg)
3. Copy the steamui.dll file if found and paste it into the **same location**   as where you copy the file in your problem computer.

**Note:**   Keep in mid that not every computer with the same system type has the dll file you want to restore, so this method is not always successful either.

### Method 5: Fix your steamui.dll file by DLL?files.com Client

 You can also fix this problem automatically by **[DLL?files.com Client](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**  DLL?files.com Client will fix any DLL error in one click and restore your PC and programs to full working order.

 An old, missing or corrupted driver might not cause this problem to occur, but it’ll cause problems to your video games, especially a wrong video driver. So we highly recommend **keeping your drivers up-to-date for the best gaming experience** .

 You can download the latest video driver from your video card’s manufacturer’s website, like AMD, NVIDIA.

Or

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all drivers problems of your computer.
