## Optimize Your Outriders Experience: No More Freezing or Hiccups

These days, **[Outriders](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/outriders?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=c6e54ebd92da4ee8819c1c0956cebdc4)**  has seen a thriving surge among gamers.

## Before getting started

 Before taking any troubleshooting steps listed below, we recommend you switch to mouse and keyboard if you’re playing Outriders with a controller. Although it seems there’s nothing to do with your controller, many players did report on Reddit that switching to mouse and keyboard helped them mitigate their problems. So it’s worth a shot.

 But if that’s not your case or this action didn’t seem to solve the issues, try the fixes below.

1. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Roll back to your previous driver (for Nvidia users)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-outriders-stuttering-freezing/#fix2)**
3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Switch to DX11](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Verify integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Disable Steam overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Close unnecessary programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Install all Windows updates

 Outriders has just been out for days. Therefore, it’s not unusual that you’re running into any sorts of issues which can make your game unplayable. But when it comes to troubleshooting the issues, installing the latest Windows updates should be the recommended step you can take. Windows updates bring new features and fix the compatibility issues especially with new titles.

Here’s how you can download and install Windows updates:

 1) In the Search box, type in **check for updates** . Then click **Check for updates**  from the results.  
  
![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/check-for-updates.png)

 2) Click on the **Check for updates**  tab. If there are any updates available, it’ll automatically start to download and install it.  
  
![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/click-on-the-Check-for-updates-tab.png)

 Once you’ve installed the latest Windows updates, launch Outriders and check if the stutters or freezes are still that noticeable during cutscenes or normal gameplay.

## 2\. Roll back to your previous driver (for Nvidia users)

 (If you’re not using a NVIDIA graphics card, simply head to[fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . )

 When it comes to troubleshoot the performance issues, we usually suggest you update your graphics driver. But there are some exceptions for NVIDIA users who are playing Outriders. Many players reported on Reddit that rolling back to a previous version can substantially remove micro-stuttering. Here’s how you can do that:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key + R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press Enter.  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/device-manager.jpg)

 3) Click on the arrow next to**Display adapters** . Right-click your device and select**Properties** .  
  
![how to roll back NVIDIA driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roll-back-your-drivers.png)

 4) Click on the**Driver** tab. Then click**Roll Back Driver** and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.  
  
![how to roll back NVIDIA driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/roll-back-driver.png)

 After you’ve done these, launch Outriders to check if it solves your issues.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is one of the core components of your computer. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU. When you have performance issues on your game, your outdated or faulty graphics driver can be the culprit. To fix it, you need to update your graphics driver. This is pretty necessary, especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated it.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website. Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version, download it, and install it manually.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

## 4\. Switch to DX11

 DX12 was designed to bring performance boost, maximize frame rate and minimize latency by optimizing hardware utilization. Having said that, in some circumstances, some titles may not really get along well with DX12 and the truth is, for many games, DX11 is still a great option. Outriders developers also[post](https://steamcommunity.com/app/680420/discussions/2/3075370188227922699/) that switching to DX11 can fix the performance issues.

Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select **Properties** .  
  
![outriders properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/outriders-Properties.png)

 2) Select the**GENERAL**  tab. Then under the**LAUNCH OPTIONS** section, type**\-force -dx11** in the text field. This command line will allow you to run your game in DX11 mode.  
  
![switch to DX11 mode Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DX11.png)

 After switching to DX11, play Outriders to check if it helps alleviate some stutters during your gameplay.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 The built-in tool “verify integrity of game files” on Steam should be utilized when you try to troubleshoot any issues you’re having with the game. It helps ensure that your game files are intact and if necessary, repair any bad or corrupted game data.

To verify the integrity of game files, take these steps:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select **Properties** .  
  
![outriders properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/outriders-Properties.png)

 2) Select the **LOCAL FILES**  tab and then click on the **Verify integrity of game files…**  button.

![verify integrity of game files Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/outriders-verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

 Steam will start verifying your game’s files and this may take several minutes. Simply wait for the process to complete.

 Once finished, play Outriders and check if your game still stutters a lot. If it is, proceed to the next fix.

## 6\. Disable Steam overlay

 The Steam overlay allows you to surf the web and message friends while in-game, but can also cause performance issues with some games. To check whether it’s causing your Outriders to stutter, you can turn off Steam overlay:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select **Properties** .  
  
![outriders properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/outriders-Properties.png)

 2) Under the**GENERAL** tab, uncheck the box next to**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
  
![disable Steam overlay Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-steam-overlay.png)

## 7\. Close unnecessary programs

 Performance issues such as the game freezing and stuttering can be caused by your limited system resources or an interference from a program running in the background. To solve your issues, you can close those programs such as web browsers, Adobe apps when playing Outriders. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **taskmgr** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard to open the Task Manager.  
  
![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)

 3) Under the **Processes** tab, right-click on the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Outriders and select **End task** .

 After you’ve done these, play Outriders to check if it should look better.
