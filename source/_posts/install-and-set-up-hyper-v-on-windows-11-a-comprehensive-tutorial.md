 You need to reconnect your DS4 controller device. If nothing changes — DS4 Windows driver not installing or DS4 Windows not detecting controller, you should move on to the next fix.

**Note:** The DS4 Windows from<http://ds4windows.com/> has not been updated for a long time. It is the one on **[DS4 Windows New Releases](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases)**  that keeps updating from time to time.

### Fix 3: Re-enable your controller

 DS4 Windows will fail to detect your PS4 if your controller is disabled. To check if this is the culprit, you can go to Device Manager.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.
