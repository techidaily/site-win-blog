## Experiencing Delays? Improve Spotify Web Player Functionality Now

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/og-image.64b84348.png)

 Spotify web player is popular since it doesn’t require the download of the desktop app and people can still enjoy Spotify music. But it’s not error-free, and users have been reporting it’s**slow, buggy or not working at all** . The good news is, there are some known fixes available. Read on to find out what they are…

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

[1: Check which device you’re playing on](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[2: Open the web player in Incognito mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[3: Clear browsing data](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[4: Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[5: Enable the web player](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[6: Check your browser extensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[7: Flush DNS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[8: Use the Spotify desktop app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Before we dive into anything advanced, make sure your Internet has a connection. Also check if your PC and the Spotify web player were just muted.

## Fix 1: Check which device you’re playing on

 You can play Spotify on your phone, your PC, and even smart TVs and displays. As long as you log into the same account, you’re able to manage and switch between the devices you wish to play music on. Sometimes when you find the Spotify web player not working, it’s because it’s playing on another device.

 To check which device you’re playing music on, simply**click the icon that’s on the left of the speaker icon** . You’ll see the current device that Spotify is playing music on. If it’s not your browser, just**click This Web Browser** then your Spotify web player should be working now.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, check the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Open the web player in Incognito mode

 Many users have been able to make the Spotify web player work again by using it in Incognito mode, so it’s definitely worth trying.

 To open an Incognito window in most browsers, first, you need to **click the three-dot icon or three-dash-line icon at the top-right corner of your browser** . Then you should find the option of**New Incognito Window, New Private Window** , or something similar.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to open an Incognito window.

* **Chrome and Microsoft Edge** :_Ctrl and Shift and N_
* **Firefox** :_Ctrl and Shift and P_

 If your Spotify web player doesn’t work even in Incognito mode, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Clear browsing data

 Sometimes there could be something wrong with your browser, but not the Spotify web player. You can clear your browser’s cookies, browsing history, and cache to see if it helps.

 Below is an example of how to clear your browsing data in Chrome. For other browsers, the steps should be similar.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Snipaste_2021-05-28_15-20-22-1200x650.png)

 Also, for most browsers, you can**open a new blank tab** , then use the hotkey**Ctrl** and**Shift** and**Delete** to bring forward the above window.

 If clearing browsing data doesn’t solve your problem, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Use a VPN

 Did you travel to another country and find that your Spotify web player doesn’t work anymore? It’s probably because your Spotify web player hasn’t updated the location yet.

 Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to simply just change the region you’re in due to copyright and accessibility issues. But you can use a VPN to unblock Spotify and enjoy music wherever you are. If you’re looking for a reliable VPN service, we have a few recommendations:

* [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Surfshark](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2F%3Fid%3Ddrivereasy-en-148671)
* [CyberGhost](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/?id=drivereasy-en-148671)
* [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/?id=drivereasy-en-148671)

If using a VPN doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Enable the web player

 If you get the error_“Playback of protected content is not enabled”_ when your Spotify web player doesn’t work, you need to manually enable the web player. Here’s how to do it:

**On Chrome:**

1. Paste**chrome://settings/content** into your browser address bar, then press the**Enter** key.
2. Scroll down until you see the option of**Additional protected content settings** . Then click the**dropdown icon** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/additional-content-settings.png)
3. Find the Protected content option, then click the**expand icon** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/protected-content.png)
4. **Switch the toggle button to the right** to allow sites to play protected content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**On Firefox:**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Check your browser extensions

 One possible reason that your Spotify web player doesn’t work is that your browser extensions may be blocking it. Many users have reported that the Spotify web player is able to work again after they**turn off ad-blocking extensions** , so it’s worth trying for sure.

 If you don’t use any ad-blocking extension, checking other extensions could still help. You can **turn the browser extensions off one by one, then test the issue** . If you can play music through the Spotify web player after you turn off a certain extension, then you know it’s the problem. Consider uninstalling this extension, updating it, or looking for an alternative for it.

## Fix 7: Flush DNS

 By flushing your DNS, your DNS cache will be cleared. When your PC needs to access a website, it’ll need to obtain the address from the DNS server again. This may get your Spotify web player back to work if the DNS cache data was invalid or corrupt. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**cmd** , then press**Shift** and**Enter** at the same time. If prompted for permission, click**Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/run-cmd.png)
3. Copy**ipconfig /flushdns** , and paste it in the pop-up window. Then press**Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/flushdns???.png)
4. Your DNS cache is successfully cleared.

If this fix doesn’t solve your problem, try the last fix.

## Fix 8: Use the Spotify desktop app

 Installing an app on your PC when there’s a webpage version available may seem unnecessary, but it’s still a choice when your Spotify web player can’t work smoothly. The[Spotify desktop app](http://spotify.com/download) is very similar to the web player and easy to use, plus it offers higher sound quality than the web player, so you may consider using it instead of the web player.
