## Origin App Won't Load? Here's How to Fix It

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdbf77b0c44d.png)

 Your Origin client can’t get online? Don’t worry… You’re not the only one. Many Origin users have had the same issue occurring on their computers. But more importantly, you should be able to fix this issue very easily

## Fixes to try

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Check your computer for virus or malware**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Temporarily disable your antivirus**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your device drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Reset your hosts file**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Reset your Internet connection settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Check your computer for viruses or malware

 Perhaps you’re having a connection issue with Origin because there is a virus or malware on your computer. They may change your Internet settings or corrupt your computer file so Origin can’t go online. You should run your antivirus software to scan your computer for viruses and malware.

 If this resolves your problem, great! But if not, there are still other fixes you can try…

### Fix 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your firewall or antivirus software can sometimes cause interference to Origin so it can’t connect to the Internet. To see if that’s the case for you, temporarily disable your firewall and see if the problem remains. (You may need to consult your firewall documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, you can contact the vendor of your firewall and ask them for advice. Or you can install a different antivirus solution.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when you have disabled your firewall.

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 Perhaps you’re having an Internet connection issue with Origin because you’re using the wrong or outdated device drivers. To fix your issue, you should try updating your drivers.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd0366bd75a4.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to_each device_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install the driver. Or click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

* Restart your computer.

### Fix 4: Reset your hosts file

 Maybe your Origin client can’t get online because your hosts file was changed. You should try resetting your hosts file to fix this issue.

**Hosts file** is a system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses.

To do so:

1. Log in your computer as the administrator.
2. Open File Explorer (by pressing the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard)
3. Copy the**following address** to the address bar, then press**Enter** on your keyboard.  
%windir%\system32\drivers\etc
