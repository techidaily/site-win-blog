### Fix 2: Remove recently installed addons

 If Kodi crashes soon after you install an add-on, the add-on is probably the culprit. To see if this is causing your problem, you should remove the add-on’s directory from Kodi’s**userdata** folder:

1. Close Kodi.
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to access **File Explorer** .
3. In the address bar, type**%APPDATA%\\Kodi\\userdata**  then press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc048ab00113.jpg)
4. Double-click on the**addon\_data** folder, and select the add-on directory that you think might be causing Kodi to crash, and press**Del** to delete it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc048c0c90e2.jpg)  

 If you’re not sure which one is the culprit, you can go back to the **userdata** folder to open the**Database** folder in it.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 If the steps above didn’t work for you, the most likely cause is a graphics driver problem.

Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your graphics driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your graphics driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6b94e4d9d8.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This require the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. )
