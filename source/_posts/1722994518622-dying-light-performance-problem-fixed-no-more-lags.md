## Fix 1: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Dying Light release regular game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused this lag issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, just download and install it to see if it can fix the game lag issue; if there’s no patches available, or if the issue persists after you installed the latest patch, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

The outdated or broken graphics driver may also lag the game.

 As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping, or lagging) and even screen flickering issues. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date so as to avoid such issues. The latest graphics driver will enhance your graphics card performance and unlock the full potential of your graphics card, which will give you an edge in PC video games.

 If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel keeps updating their graphics drivers. To get them , you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
