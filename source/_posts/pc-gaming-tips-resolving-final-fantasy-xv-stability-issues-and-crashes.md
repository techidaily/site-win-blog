 So if your computer is overclocking your CPU, try to**set it back to default** and see if it helps with your Final Fantasy crashing issue.

### Fix 2: Verify the game files

 Final Fantasy may crash if there is any corrupted game file, so you can try verifying integrity of game files in Steam app if games crash. Here’s how to do it:

1) Open Steam in your computer, and log into your Steam account.

2) Click**Library** .

 5) Steam will check your game files and fix any detected problems. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

 6) Restart Steam, and open Final Fantasy XV again and see if it works properly.

 If your game stops crashing, that’s perfect. But if your problem persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Roll back your graphics card driver

 If you’ve updated your graphics card driver right before Final Fantasy keeps crashing, your problem probably lies in your graphics card driver. In this case, you can roll back your graphics driver.

 There are two ways to roll back your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

* Manually roll back your driver: you can roll back your graphics card driver by navigating to**Device Manager** \>**Display adapters** \>**Properties** \>**Driver** \>**Roll Back Driver** .

This requires time and computer skills.

* Automatically roll back your driver: if you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

### Fix 4: Modify your pagefile size

 6) If the pagefile size is already set manually, you can set your pagefile size automatically. Just check the box next to**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** . Then click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Snap45.jpg)

 If your PC is set to automatically manage paging file size, you can manually set the pagefile size:

 a. Uncheck**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** ,  
 b. Choose**Custom size** ,  
 c. Enter the**Initial size** and**Maximum size** (If you have 16 GB RAM you should set the Maximum size to 2.5 GB).  
 d. Click**Set** .  
 e. Click**OK** to save.

7) After changing your pagefile size, restart Windows.

 Open Final Fantasy and see if it stops crashing. Still no luck? Don’t give up hope. There are other solutions.

### Fix 5: Disable NVIDIA Turf Effects

 NVIDIA Turf Effects simulates and renders large grass areas, which provides you with a best possible experience when playing Final Fantasy. However, Turf Effects may cause a memory problem and that could be a reason of your game crashing.

To resolve Final Fantasy crashing, you can disable NVIDIA Turf Effects.

 1) Launch FFXV**Settings** .

 2) Go to**Graphics** \>**NVIDIA TurfEffects** . Then set it to**Off** .

3) Save your changes and relaunch FFXV.

 If you can’t open Settings in Final Fantasy XV, you can modify the game settings file in your computer, and change**NvidiaTurf=0** . This will disable NVIDIA Turf Effects for your game.

Hopefully your game will be running up again properly.

### Fix 6: Reinstall your game

 If, unfortunately, the methods above didn’t help resolve your game crashing issue, try uninstalling it from your computer, then reinstall it.

 Usually, this will reset the game settings and clear the game cache, and it may remove what causes your game to crash. Then it resolves your problem as well.
