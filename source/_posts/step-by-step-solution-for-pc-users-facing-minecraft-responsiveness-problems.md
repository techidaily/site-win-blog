## Try these fixes

 Except for hardware issue, the “Skyrim no sound” issue can be caused by software; driver; incorrect settings or the corrupted game files.  
 Before we dig in deeply, let’s try the simplest but most useful way first–**restart your steam and your computer** .  
 If the reboot doesn’t work, let’s try other fixes. You don’t need to try them all, work your way down till find the one that works for you.

1. **[Check your headset software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Install DirectX from the Skyrim](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your headset software

 If your headset has a supporting software, you need to check it first. In case it was muted there. Take the Razer headset for example. You need to go into Razer Synapse to check, if it was muted in the software, you won’t get sound.

### Fix 2: Update your audio drivers

 It is very important to update your audio drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter Skyrim no sound issue. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-skyrim-no-sound-problem/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download audio drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your audio drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 4: Install DirectX from the Skyrim

 DirectX is a program that supports tasks related to multimedia, game programming, and other applications. Now modern Windows operating system would include DirectX by default but if you’re using a previous operating system, you may need to download and install DirectX from Microsft to fix this issue.

**HOW** : Go to the[Microsoft official website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) to downloaded DirectX. Install it in the Skyrim directly.

Reboot your computer, it should be work.
