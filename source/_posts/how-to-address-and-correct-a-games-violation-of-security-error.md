### Fix 1: Check the number of seed/peer

 The Stalled status usually appeared when you try to download torrents that have a low number of seed/peers. So you can check the number of speed/peer first. You can reconnect to peers by reinserting torrent in it and the speed will recover a bit. It’s just a temporary fix but worth trying.

 If your speed/peers were fine, you can restart the qBittorrent. Some users said after reboot the program, the qBittorrent client works like a charm.

### Fix 2: Your ISP might be throttling

 If your speed/peers were fine and restarting doesn’t make a difference, check your internet connection. Your ISP might be throttling which leads to Stalled status.

 Some ISPs limit the amount of high-speed data you can access, to make sure, you need to test your internet speed.

1. Test your internet speed without a VPN. Keep the number.
2. Run your VPN service. If you don’t have VPN,[download and install NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
3. Launch NordVPN and click**Connect** .

4. Test your internet speed with[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Since[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) hides your IP address from your ISP, you’ll get an accurate reading of your real internet speed. If the number has a big difference, your ISP might be throttling.

Then you should use NordVPN when downloading torrents with qBittorrent.

### Fix 3: Check your hard drive space

 Some users have reported when your drive was full, no more data could be written to it which cause the qBittorrent to be stalled issue.

 You can adjust the install destination to a desirable place, or you can clean up the disc by deleting useless files.

### Fix 4: Reinstall the application

 Some users install qBittorrent in an external HDD drive. Once you remove the default drive, it might cause the qBittorrent stalled status. It’s because the program couldn’t find the default folder.

1. In the search bar, type control to open the Control Panel.
