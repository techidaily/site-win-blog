3. [Disable antivirus](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Remove periphery devices

 This should be the first thing to do when problems occur. This is the easiest way to check whether external devices conflict with Windows Updating Process. By removing all periphery hardware components except for the mouse and keyboard, we’ll know whether it’s a hardware issue.

 If this does sort out the issue, try plugging back each device one by one. In this way, you can recognize which device causes the problem.

 If it’s not sorting out the issue, let’s head to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Disable antivirus

 The third-party antivirus software is installed to protect our PC from malware attacks, but sometimes they could be the culprit for PC errors.

 During the Windows updating process, the third-party antivirus could interfere and block the new files which can cause the Windows Update error code 0xc19001e1.

 Therefore, disable the antivirus software then restart your PC to apply the change. Update your Windows system and see if it fixes the issue.

Don’t forget to enable the software afterward.

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 This should free up an amount of space for you. But if that isn’t enough for you, then you should check if there are other files or programs you may want to remove:

1. Click the**left arrow** in the upper left corner of the window to go back to the storage settings.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f0094a368f.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
\* The following are a few things we recommend you take a look at:  
   * **The data type that uses the most amount of space**  
   * **Apps & Games** to see if there are any program installed you don’t need  
   * **Temporary files**  
   * **Desktop**  
   * …  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f07dd26e5a.jpg)

 This should free up a lot of space for your Windows 10 computer. Reboot your PC and update your system.
