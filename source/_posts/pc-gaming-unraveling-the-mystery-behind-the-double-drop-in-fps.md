## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, the broken or outdated graphics driver is the main culprit behind the Premiere Pro crashing issues.

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, or if the graphics driver file is broken or corrupted, you may suffer from the program crashing, stuttering, and even screen flickering issues.

 Graphics card manufacturers like_Nvidia_ ,_AMD_ and_Intel_ keeps updating their graphics drivers. By doing that, they’ll fix bugs in the last version of graphics driver and enhance the graphics card performance. Sometimes, they also provides support for the new features in creative applications. For example:

> _The March NVIDIA Studio Driver provides optimal support for the latest AI-powered features in creative applications including Adobe Camera Raw,**Adobe Premiere Pro** , and DaVinci Resolve 17._

 In other words, the latest graphics driver will unlock the full potential of your graphics card and give you a better experience for creating and gaming.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Your graphics card manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them , you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**Or**

### Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 You need to restart your PC after you finished updating your graphics driver.

 If the latest graphics driver fails to stop the crash, just read on to try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Reset your preferences

It’s quite easy to reset your preferences. Here’s how:

1. Hold the**Alt** key when you click to launch Premiere Pro. This will invoke a popup asking if you want to reset your preferences.  
![Reset your preferences in Premiere Pro](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reset-your-preferences-in-Premiere-Pro.jpg)
2. Click**OK** to confirm.

 See if the Premiere Pro crashing issue persists. If this fix doesn’t stop the crashing, don’t worry. Try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Turn off GPU acceleration

 GPU acceleration is one of the common causes of Premiere Pro crashing. If you’ve turned on GPU acceleration, temporarily disable it to see if you can fix Premiere Pro crashing. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Premiere Pro and go to**File** \>**Project Settings** \>**General** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png" border="0">Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Turn off GPU acceleration in Premiere Pro](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Turn-off-GPU-acceleration-in-Premiere-Pro.jpg)
2. In the**Video Rendering and Playback** part, set**Renderer** option to**Mercury Playback Engine Software Only** . Click**OK** to save the change.

![set Premiere Pro Renderer option to Mercury Playback Engine Software Only](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/set-Premiere-Pro-Renderer-option-to-Mercury-Playback-Engine-Software-Only.jpg)

 See if Premiere Pro crashes after you switched GPU acceleration to Software Only. Usually, Premiere Pro may take more time to finish rendering after you disabled GPU acceleration, but it would reduce the frequency of random crashes.

If this fix doesn’t work, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Remove media cache files

 Some corrupted media cache files may also trigger Premiere Por crashing issue. If it’s the case, you need to remove media cache files. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Premiere Pro and go to**Edit** \>**Preferences** \>**Media Cache** .  
![Premiere Pro Remove media cache files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Premiere-Pro-Remove-media-cache-files.jpg)
2. Click the**Delete…** button to remove media cache files.  
![Premiere Pro Remove media cache files 1](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Premiere-Pro-Remove-media-cache-files-1.jpg)

See if this fix stops the crashing. If not, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Close CPU / memory hogging applications

 Premiere Pro is a resource intensive application. If you’re running lots of applications at the same time in the background, your computer may run out of RAM and causes Premiere Pro to crash. If it’s the case, closing those CPU / memory hogging applications may get Premiere Pro work again, Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open**Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click**Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of**CPU** or**memory** , then click**End task** to close it.  
![Close CPU memory hogging applications](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Close-CPU-memory-hogging-applications.jpg)

 If Premiere Pro works well after you closed those CPU / memory hogging applications, congratulations!

 To prevent Premiere Pro from crashing due to insufficient memory in the future, you may need to consider upgrading the memory (RAM) on your computer.

## Fix 6: Check for overheating components

 Premiere Pro utilizes both CPU and GPU to perform heavy computations. If Premiere Pro runs on your computer for a long time, your computer may get overheated, especially when its cooling system is not working properly. Once your computer got overheated, Premiere Pro may crash without warning. If it’s the case, you need to cool your computer down.

To cool down your computer, you may need to

* **Clean the dust** from the fans and vents of your computer.
* Make sure your computer is in a**cool environment.**
* Use a**better cooling system** for your computer if yours is not powerful enough.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Update / reinstall Premier Pro

 If none of the fixes works, try updating / reinstalling Premier Pro. Normally, after updating Premier Pro to the latest version, or reinstalling it, you’ll fix the crashing issue.

## Conclusion

 In most cases, keeping Premier Pro, Windows OS and drivers up to date would get rid of most program crashing issues.
