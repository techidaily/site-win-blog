## Fix 1: Make sure your PC meets the specs

 Before you can get started playing Death Stranding, you need to check whether or not your PC is well-equipped to handle the game at the quality within your expectation.

| **OS**         | Windows 10                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | Intel CoreTM i5-3470 or AMD RyzenTM 3 1200        |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB RAM                                          |
| **Graphics**   | GeForce GTX 1050 3 GB or AMD RadeonTM RX 560 4 GB |
| **DirectX**    | Version 12                                        |
| **Storage**    | 80 GB available space                             |
| **Sound Card** | DirectX compatible                                |

 3) Once the download is completed, click on the**dxwebsetup.exe** file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

 4) Now restart your computer.

 When you’re sure that your PC perfectly meets the system requirements but the game just keeps crashing, you should try the methods listed in this article.

## Fix 2: Allow your game through the firewall or disable anti-virus software

 Windows Firewall or antivirus software is developed to detect and remove computer viruses. But there are situations when they fail to grant the authority to legitimate applications like your games. So if it happens to you, you should allow your game through[Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and disable your[antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) temporarily.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Video games are graphics-intensive. If your game keeps crashing, the possibility is that your graphics driver is corrupt or outdated. In this case, you need to update your graphics driver as your problem could be solved immediately.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/death-stranding-crashing/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1 – Download and install the drivers manually

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

 If you’re an Nvidia user, you can also update your driver from the[Geforce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) application. What’s more, Death Stranding is one of the games that can take advantage of[optimal settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/games/) .

## Fix 4: Clear temp files from your PC

 Temporary files, sometimes referred to as_temp files_ , are only needed to exist temporarily while in use. They consume some disk space, which can slow down your computer or even cause a crashing issue when you’re playing games. So you can delete them and it shouldn’t cause any problems.

Here’s how you can do it:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together on your keyboard to open the**Run** dialogue box.

 2) Type**%temp%** and press**Enter** .

![delete temp files Death Stranding crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files.jpg)

 3) Select all the folders (press**Ctrl + A** ). Right-click and select**Delete** .

![delete temp files Death Stranding crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files-2-2.jpg)

 After deleting temp files, relaunch your game to check if the crashing issue persists. If it still crashes, don’t worry, there are a few other fixes for you.
