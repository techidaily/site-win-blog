## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Low FPS, lagging gameplay, or poor graphics aren’t always caused by an old graphics card. Sometimes, updating your graphics driver can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make your game significantly run smoother. Moreover, updating your graphics can ensure that you always have the newest features. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now as it can make a big difference.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update your graphics driver manually by heading to the manufacturer’s driver download page:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 As described above, updating drivers manually does require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

 2) Click**Privacy** .
