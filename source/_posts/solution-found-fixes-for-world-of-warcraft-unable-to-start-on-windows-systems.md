7. **[Try another version of Afterburner](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your cable connection

 First you need to**be sure that you have the right display port** . If you’re using the wrong port, say you have your monitor hooked up with the integrated graphics, your GPU might not show up in Afterburner since you’re not using it for display.

You should also rule out the possibility of faulty cables.

 If you’re sure you got the right port, you can continue to the troubleshooting below.

### Fix 2: Change properties of MSI Afterburner

 According to some players, a possible fix of the issue lies in the**compatibility settings** of Afterburner. You can follow suit and see if it works in your case.

1. Open MSI Afterburner. In the left pane, click the**gear icon** to open properties.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/msi-afterburner-settings-1.jpg)
2. In the**Compatibility settings** section, uncheck the box next to**Enable low-level IO driver** .

3. Restart your PC and check the results in MSI Afterburner.

If this trick doesn’t help you. take a look at the next one below.

### Fix 3: Check if you have Vanguard

 If you’re into Valorant, you might be familiar with**Vanguard** , the anti-cheat program. Records show that Vanguard is a big time trouble maker that is responsible for many game issues. And many players reported that it has something to do with Afterburner not detecting GPU. So if you have Vanguard on your system, you can try to disable/uninstall it and see if Afterburner works properly.

### Fix 4: Update all your drivers

 If you’re not seeing your GPU in MSI Afterburner, chances are you might be using**a buggy or outdated graphics driver** . In fact, for your rig to function properly, you should always make sure you have all the drivers up to date.

 You can update drivers manually, by visiting the graphics, motherboard manufacturers one by one, finding the latest correct installers and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-killer-networking-rtx-2060-clean.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating all your drivers, restart your PC and check if Afterburner is working properly.

 If the latest drivers don’t give you luck, you can continue to the next method.

### Fix 5: Check for Windows updates

 Windows updates help you avoid most of the**software compatibility issues** . You should always make sure you’re on the latest system.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once done, restart your computer and check if MSI Afterburner is running correctly.

If the issue lingers on, you can continue to the next fix.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 In addition to Vanguard, you should check if there’re other interferences in your system. You can start by**doing a clean boot** , which only starts the PC with the minimum set of services and programs.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering, and click **Disable** .

6. Restart your PC.

 If Afterburner works after the clean boot, you can root out the offenders by repeating the steps and disabling only half of the services and programs.

If the issue persists, you can try the next solution below.

### Fix 7: Try another version of Afterburner

 If none of the fixes can help you, you can try to reinstall MSI Afterburner. This should reset profiles and fix possible issues during installation. Instead of installing the same version, this time you can try the previous and beta ones, which can be easily found on[Guru3D.com](https://www.guru3d.com/files/index.html) .
