 Now check to see if this fixed your Discord update issue. Hopefully it did, but if not there are still other fixes you can try.

### Fix 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your firewall or antivirus software can sometimes cause interference to your Discord update connection. To see if that’s the case for you, temporarily disable your firewall and see if the problem remains. (You may need to consult your firewall documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, You can contact the vendor of your firewall and ask them for advice. Or you can install a different antivirus solution.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when you have disabled your firewall.
