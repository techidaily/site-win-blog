### 1\. Update the game

 You’ll see some people have reported that they solve the problem by plugging in speakers or headset into the system. An active audio source is required to play Stardew Valley. But the developer team has fixed it in update 1.4\. So if you’re playing the older version and encounter this issue, update the game would help you get rid of it.

Right now Stardew Valley 1.5.4 patch has been released on PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Delete the startup preferences folder

 Stardew Valley will use a specific file to store the startup preferences for users, but this file could be the culprit of not working/ not launching issue. You can delete the startup preferences file to fix the problem.

Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type**%appdata%** and press the**Enter** key.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/appdata.jpg)
3. Find and open the**Stardew Valley** folder.

<a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818" border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Find the**startup\_preferences** folder then delete it.
5. Launch the game to check.

Make sure you’ve verified the Steam Files as well.

1. Open the Steam client and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** , then **right-click** on**Stardew Valley** and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-verify-the-game-file-1.png)
2. Click **the LOCAL FILES tab** , then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE…** . After that, click **CLOSE** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-verify-the-game-file-2.png)

If it doesn’t work, move to the next fix.

### 3\. Install XNA installer

 Stardew Valley is a video game using the Microsoft XNA framework. Therefore, this framework needs to be installed and running properly. This fix would show you how to run the installer.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type**%appdata%** and press the**Enter** key.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/appdata.jpg)
3. Find and open the**Stardew Valley** folder.
4. Find the**\_Redist** folder, then run**xnafx40\_redist installer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-29_14-30-45.jpg)
5. When the whole process is finished, back to the upper folder, right-click on Stardew Valley and click**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-29_14-36-48.jpg)
6. The game should launch normally.

 Don’t bother downloading the Microsoft XNA framework, Microsoft has removed it from their official website.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Update d3d9.dll

 The older version of d3d9.dll could be the reason for the Stardew Valley not launching issue. To do this, you need to know that the fix might be harmful if the DLL file you download from the internet contains viruses or malware.

1. Back up your data.
2. Download the latest version of d3d9.dll from the[internet](https://www.dll-files.com/) .
3. Copy the DLL file and navigate to`C:\Windows\System32` .
4. Paste the new DLL file and replace the old one.
5. Right-click on the 32-bit files and copy.
6. Navigate to`C:\Windows\SysWOW64` and paste the file to replace the old one.
7. Run Stardew Valley to check.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Set Launch Options in Steam

 Setting up the Steam Launch options would be a usable fix for Stardew Valley.

1. Open the Steam**Library** , right-click on**Stardew Vally,** and select**Properties** .
2. In the General tab, click**SET LAUNCH OPTIONS.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-29_15-15-13.jpg)
3. Make sure the pop-up window’s box is empty. Then click**OK** to save the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Run Stardew Valley to check.

 We’ve collected all the methods that you may don’t know. I believe you’ve already tried reboot, reinstall the game, verify the game files, Run Stardew Valley as administrator and shut down antivirus or firewall.

 If none of the fixes would help you solve the problem, I suggest you can contact the developer team for help. They have a[forum](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports.12/) to receive feedback.

### Bonus tip: Update your driver

 To get a better gaming experience on your PC, it’s important to keep your drivers up to date. An updated driver would prevent your PC from potential problems and make your PC running smoothly.

 However, Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. Don’t worry, there are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-stardew-valley-wont-launch/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-Geoforce.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

## For mobile users

 The game crashing on mobile phones is not a wide issue, but if you experience this problem, the fix would help.

 Here I list how to fix the crash on Android phone, the step would be the same as on iOS system.

1. Make sure you’ve updated the game to the latest version.
2. There are no background apps running on your phone.
3. Try switching between WiFi and mobile data.

 If this doesn’t help, you can report the crash bug attached with your save file to the[forums’ support team](https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/stardew-valley-android-ios-known-issues-and-fixes.153425/) .

Save file location:

* **iOS** : Your Phone > Apps > Stardew Valley > Documents
* **Android** : Your Phone > Internal Shared Storage > Stardew Valley
