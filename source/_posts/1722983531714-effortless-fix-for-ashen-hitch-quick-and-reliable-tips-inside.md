### Fix 5 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 If you’ve installed antivirus programs to protect your computer from potential threats, they can sometimes be overprotective and mistakenly block your games like Madden 22 from working.

 To determine whether it’s the culprit, you should temporarily disable your antivirus. If the problem is fixed, you need to**whitelist Madden 22 in the anti-virus programs** so that you can use both without conflicts. Just select the software you’re using and follow the guides:

* [McAfee](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/application-control-8.2.0-product-guide-windows/page/GUID-3205E6EF-C5FC-458C-B326-99E9679E291B.html)
* [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/consumer/support/answer/13427/)
* [Avast](https://support.avast.com/en-sg/article/Antivirus-scan-exclusions)
* [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/kaspersky-add-exclusion/14765/#:~:text=Open%20the%20settings%20Kaspersky%20Internet,scope%20in%20Kaspersky%20Internet%20Security.)

 If disabling the antivirus doesn’t give you luck, then it is not to blame.

 You may consider reinstalling Madden 22 as the last resort if all the methods above can’t help. A fresh reinstallation can usually resolve the stubborn issues during your previous installation, but please remember to**delete all the remaining game files** after you uninstall the game.
