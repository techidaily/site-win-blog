### Fix 5 – Delete the game cache files

 The faulty game files can also lead to various issues with Warzone including the 6328 dev error. In this case, you should try cleaning up the cache.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**%programdata%** and press**Enter** .
2. Delete the **Battle.net**  and **Blizzard Entertainment** folder.

 Restart the Battle.net client and see whether you could play Warzone as normal. If the game is still unplayable, try the last method.

### Fix 6 – Adjust the in-game graphics settings

 If you’re able to get into Warzone and the error 6328 appears only in the middle of the game, tweaking certain graphics settings might help the situation. Here’s how:

1. Launch CoD Warzone and access the**Options** menu.
2. Navigate to the**Graphics** tab. Then set the_Display Mode_ to**Fullscreen Borderless** , and turn_Sync Every Frame (V-Sync)_ to**On (Enabled)** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/graphics-settings1.jpg)
3. Scroll down to the Details & Textures section and set_Texture Resolution_ and_Texture Filter Anisotropic_ to**Normal** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/graphics-settings2.jpg)

 Save the changes and restart Warzone to test. Then the game should be running perfectly without the 6328 error code.
