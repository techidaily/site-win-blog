##  Select From the Available Date and Time Formats

 The first option to change the date and time format is to pick from preset formats using the Settings app. Right-click on the Start button and select "Settings." Navigate to the "Time and Language" tab on the left and open the "Language and Region" settings on the right.

 Within the Region section, click on the "Regional Format" optionâ€”ensure that you do not click on the dropdown menu but on the blank space. Then, click on the "Change Formats" button.

 In this menu, select your preferred date and time format next to "Short Date" and "Long Date," as well as "Short Time" and "Long Time."

 Remember that Windows displays the short date and short time formats in the taskbar. These are values you need to edit to have the taskbar display your preferred format. If you're using Windows 10, the process to [change the date and time format](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-water-and-liquid-game-simulations-unveiled/) is slightly different.

##  Set a Custom Date and Time Format

 To set a custom date and time format on Windows, type "Region" in Windows Search and open the Region settings.

 Navigate to the "Formats" tab and click the "Additional Settings" button in the lower-right corner. Then, move to the "Time" tab and select your preferred time format next to "Short Time" and "Long Time" from the options provided. Otherwise, use the notation provided at the end of the window to set a custom format. After adding the desired formats, click "Apply" and "OK."
