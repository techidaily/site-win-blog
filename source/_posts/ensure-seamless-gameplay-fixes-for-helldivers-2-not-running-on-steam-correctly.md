#### Minimum requirements

| **OS:**        | Windows 10 (64 bit)                                                                          |

### Fix 2: Verify your game files

 The constant crash may indicate an**integrity issue with your game files** . If that’s the case, your game might keep crashing at a certain scene or chapter. You should make sure there’s nothing wrong with your game files.

Here’s an example of how to check the game integrity on Steam:

1. Open your Steam client. Navigate to the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click**Detroit: Become Human** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/detroit-become-human-verify-game-01.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab, then select**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

### Fix 3:**Close all** background**applications**

 Detroit: Become Human is a demanding game, and the crash can occur when you have some other large programs eating up your CPU resources and RAM. So if you’re running big programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** or**Windows Update** , be sure to close them before launching your game.

If this fix failed to solve your issue, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 More often than not, the crash of new games tends to be graphics-related. It usually indicates that you’re using**a** **faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Whether you’re using a 1,000 dollars gaming rig or just a five-year-old school laptop, always make sure you make the most out of it, with the latest graphics driver.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, first visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then search for your exact GPU model. Remember to download the latest correct installer that’s compatible with your operating system. And always restart your PC after updating device drivers.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 6: Disable in-game overlays

 In-game overlay is a feature that makes it convenient to purchase game items and interact with friends on third party platforms. But in some cases, it might become the cause of instability.

For example, you can follow these steps to disable Steam overlay:

1. Open your**Steam client** . In the top left corner, click**Steam** select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steam-disable-overlay.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select**In-Game** . Under**The Steam Overlay** section, uncheck these boxes. Then click**OK** to save the changes.

### Fix 7: Disable your controller

 Some gamers reported that they managed to stop the crash in Detroit: Become Human by**unplugging their controllers** .

### Fix 8: Roll back your graphics driver

 According to some players, one potential fix is rolling back the graphics driver. If you’re using an NVIDIA GPU,**try version 446.14 or 451.67** . Also don’t forget to check if the driver supports your GPU.
