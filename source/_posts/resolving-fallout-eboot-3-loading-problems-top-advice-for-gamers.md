### Fix 3: Change the resolutions back to your monitor size

 You probably run Fallout 4 in the borderless mode, it’s great. But there’s one thing you should check after setting the borderless mode — change the resolutions back to your monitor size:

#### Step 1: Check the recommended resolutions of your monitor

 On your desktop, right-click on the blank area to select**Display Settings** (Windows 10) /**Screen Resolutions** (Windows 7). Then check the resolutions with the**Recommended** character. (You will need to set this same resolution in Fallout 4). Generally, this is your monitor size.  
  
 Usually your system is set to the recommend resolution, if it’s not, set it to be.

**bFull Screen=0**  
**iSize H=1080**  
**iSize W=1920**
3. Save the file and exit Notepad.

### Fix 5: Adjust the frame rate

**Frame rate** refers to the number of individual images that are displayed per second in your game display. If the frame rate of Fallout 4 on your system drops, everything will**slow down** .**58 fps** is the recommended frame rate you can set. Why 58? It’s some kind of magic number as the least problems happen at this frame rate.

Here’s how you can set the frame rate of Fallout 4:

**V-sync** (vertical sync) is the synchronization of your frame rate with the maximum refresh rat of the display being used. So being enabled, V-sync would**limits the frame rate** of your game. If the frame rates is low, everything displaying on Fallout 4 will slowdown. In this case, we recommend disabling the V-sync feature.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Go to the location of your Fallout 4 game documents. Basically, it locates in:  

 **C:\\Users\\YourWindowsName\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout4**
