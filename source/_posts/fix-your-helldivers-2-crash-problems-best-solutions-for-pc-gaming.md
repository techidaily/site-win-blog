### Fix 2: Run Scan and Repair for Starcraft 2

 If you run into any Blizzard in-game problems, you can try the**Scan and Repair** feature in the**Battle.net application** , which automatically scans and repairs the problems in your game. To scan and repair your Starcraft 2, here’s how to do it:

1. Open the Blizzard Battle.net desktop app.
2. Select your Starcraft 2.
3. Click![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/options.png) below the title of the game and select**Scan and Repair** .
4. Click**Begin Scan** .
5. Wait for the repair to finish.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If you’re an avid gamer, you must know how important a graphics card driver means, and how an outdated or corrupt graphics card driver causes your game to crash, lag or load forever, etc. Therefore, you should always check the current driver version and keep your graphics card driver up-to-date.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver: **manually** and **automatically** .

#### Option 1:**Manual driver update**

 Graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs and improve game performance. You can find your graphics card driver and download the latest version from its official website:

* [AMD Driver Download](http://www.amd.com/drivers)
* [NVIDIA Driver Download](http://www.nvidia.com/drivers)
* [Intel Driver Download](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/)

 Then download the driver that is compatible with your Windows OS, and manually install it in your computer.

#### Option 2:**Automatic driver update**

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers on your computer.  
![scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scan-now-5.png)
3. Click the Update button next to the flagged video card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the FREE version), then install the driver manually on your computer.  

**OR** click**_Update All_** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_Update All_ , which comes with a 30-day no question asked money back guarantee.)  
![update your drivers by clicking Update or Update all](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/update-all-your-drivers-2-9.jpg)  
 _Note: If you experience any problems when using Driver Easy Pro, please contact our support team at_ [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
4. Restart your computer and check if**Starcraft 2 crashing issue** s still persist.

### Fix 4: Stop overclocking

 Overclocking your video cards is not supported and may cause**performance or crash issues in StarCraft 2** . To undo the overclocking, you’ll need to enter the CMOS and BIOS settings of the system and reverse all the changes back to default.

 To disable overclocking of your Nvidia GPU in a simple way, you can try its**Debug Mode** :

_Note: This method applies only to the_ non-reference model cards_._

1. Right-click your desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel.  
![Open NVIDIA control panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NVIDIA-control-panel.jpg)
2. Expand the**Help** menu, and check the**Debug Mode** option.

 This will help you downclock any factory overclocked graphics card to Nvidia reference clock speeds. Although generally speaking, overclocking provides better performance in games and graphics-intensive applications, it can sometimes cause crashing issues and shorten the lifespan of your graphics card.

### Fix 5: Reset your Starcraft 2 in-game options
