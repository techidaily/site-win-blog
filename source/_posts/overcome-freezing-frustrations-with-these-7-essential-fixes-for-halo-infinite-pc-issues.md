### Fix 5: Check for software conflicts

 Sometimes the software conflicts can cause FPS drops in CS:GO, especially when you’ve installed any software, or turn on any features in your computer. So check it out.

Below shows you examples of the programs that usually cause conflicts:

* Antivirus programs, such as Windows Defender.
* Overlay programs, such as GeForce Experience
* Programs that you just installed
* Windows built-in features, like Firewall

 Try closing or uninstalling these programs, and see if it fixes your problem. If so, contact the developer of the software for advice.

 Note: If you close antivirus program, or Windows firewall, be extra careful about the website, emails, and links you open. And remember to re-open it later on.
