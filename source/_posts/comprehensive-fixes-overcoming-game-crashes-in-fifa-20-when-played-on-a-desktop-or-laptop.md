### Fix 3 – Update your device drivers

 If rolling back the graphics driver doesn’t help, it’s likely that your device drivers are faulty or outdated. To fix the constant FIFA 21 crashes and avoid other potential gaming issues, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

### Fix 6 – Modify the in-game settings

 You may have set high in-game settings for a better visual effect and gaming experience, but if your computer is not powerful enough to cope with that, FIFA 21 will crash. You can try the following lower settings:

**1)** Launch FIFA 21 and click**Game Settings** from the menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_17-32-34.jpg)

**2)** Set the settings as below:

* **Resolution** : Windowed Borderless
* **Rendering Quality** : Low
* **MSAAOptions** : Off

 So how FIFA 21 works with the new settings? If it still crashes, please check out the next fix.

### Fix 7 – Disable overlay
