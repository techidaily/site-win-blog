### Fix 2: End unnecessary background programs

 Background programs and processes could slow down your computer and cause it to overload. Try turning off unneeded applications on your computer to see if any of them are causing your issue. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-35-01.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the game crashing issue is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. To run_FM19_ smoothly, it’s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver.

 You can update your device drivers manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-37-07.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your game still crashes, then go ahead with the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**5)** Relaunch your game after the process is finished.

 You should now be able to launch your game and actually play! If not, try the fix, below.

### Fix 5:**Delete the Preferences and Caches Folder**

 Game cache files could also affect the performance of your game. Try clearing the_FM19_ Cache and Preferences folder to see if it fixes your issue. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Make sure your game and Steam aren’t running on your PC.

**2)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**E** at the same time.

 Try launching your game again. If your problem still exists, don’t fret. There are still 2 more fixes to try.

### Fix 7: Change the power option

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and R at the same time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-11-45-3.jpg)
