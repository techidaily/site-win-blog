 If you want to find numbers that are above or below average, you don't have to [calculate that average](https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixing-overwatch-startup-issues-how-to-get-rid-of-the-persistent-black-screen/) and then review the values for those higher or lower. With conditional formatting in Excel, you can automatically highlight those numbers.

 Along with a quick way to highlight values above or below average, you can go a step further and see those that are equal to and higher or equal to and lower. Depending on what you want to display, let's look at how to use [conditional formatting in Microsoft Excel](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-asmr-video-insights/) for averages.

##  Set Up a Quick Conditional Formatting Rule

 Open the sheet in Excel you want to work with and select the cells you want to use. You can choose a column, row, cell range, or non-adjacent cells.

 Go to the Home tab and click the Conditional Formatting drop-down arrow in the Styles section of the ribbon. Move your cursor to Top/Bottom Rules and you'll see Above Average and Below Average in the pop-out menu. Pick the one you want to use.

 In the pop-up window, you'll see a few default formats in the drop-down list. Select the one you want and click "OK."

 You'll then see the cells that apply to the rule you set formatted with the option you picked.

##  Create a More Detailed Formatting Rule

 The quick [formatting rule](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/manipulate-sound-rate-in-youtube-playback-for-2024/) above is handy for a fast way to see numbers above or below average. But you may want more detail or different formatting. By creating a rule from scratch, you can tailor it to fit your needs.
