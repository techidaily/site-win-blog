## Fix 1: Make sure Minecraft is using the dedicated GPU

 Sometimes the operating system won’t recognize Minecraft as a game and won’t run it with the dedicated GPU for high performance. If that’s the case for you, you’re likely to experience stuttering in Minecraft. To fix it, you can force the game to use the dedicated GPU via Graphics settings. Here’s how:

1. Right-click your desktop and select**Display settings** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/display-settings.jpg)
2. In Display settings, scroll down the page and select**Graphics settings** .

 Once done, run Minecraft again and see if the stuttering issue still appears.

If this solution doesn’t help, continue with the next fix below.

If the stuttering issue persists, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Lower your Render Distance

 In Minecraft, chunks make up your world. And the render distance controls how many chunks of the world are visible at once. So if you set a high value of chunks, you may face the issue of fps drops or stuttering. To get better performance, you should lower the value to 8 or less, depending on your PC’s hardware. Here’s how:

1. Run Minecraft on your computer.
2. Click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/options.jpg)
3. Click**Video Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/video-settings.jpg)
4. Lower the**Render distance** according to your need.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/render-distance-1.jpg)

This should give you a better game experience.

But if it doesn’t, take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 4: Enable VSync

 Sometimes the stuttering issue might occur due to a frame rate discrepancy between the monitor and GPU. But luckily you can fix it by enabling VSync in your graphics control panel.

### Via NVIDIA Control Panel

1. Right-click your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left panel, select**Manage 3D Settings** , then click the dropdown menu next to**Vertical sync** and select**On** . Click**Apply** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/turn-on-vsync.jpg)

### Via AMD Radeon Settings

1. Right-click your desktop and select**AMD Radeon Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amdradeon-settings.jpg)
2. Click the**Gaming** Tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amd-gaming-1.jpg)
3. Then click**Global Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amd-global-settings-1.jpg)
4. Click**Wait for Vertical Refresh** , then select**Enhanced Sync** from the dropdown menu.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/enhanced-sync-1.jpg)

 After you’ve done these, relaunch Minecraft to check if the stuttering persists.

If enabling Vsync didn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Turn off threaded optimization

 Threaded optimization is a setting in NVIDIA Control Panel that controls the use of multithreaded optimization for all 3D games on systems with multi-core/HyperThreaded CPUs. Most new games perform better with threaded optimization enabled. However, some gamers reported that they fixed the stuttering issue in Minecraft by turning off threaded optimization. You can give it a shot. To do so:

1. Right-click your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** from the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left panel, click**Manage 3D settings** , navigate to the**Program Settings** tab, and select**Minecraft Launcher.exe** from the first dropdown menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
After doing so, restart Minecraft and check if the problem is resolved.

If the stuttering issue remains, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Allocate more RAM

 The RAM helps computers improve frame rates and frame pacing during gaming. In many cases, you need to allocate more RAM to games, especially for the games that use a lot of mods, like Minecraft. To do so:

1. Open your**Minecraft client** and navigate to the**Installations** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Installations1.jpg)
2. Click the**three dots** button next to Minecraft, then select**Edit** from the dropdown menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/more-options.jpg)
4. Under the**JVM ARGUMENTS** section, there’s a line of text. **Change the amount of RAM that Minecraft can utilize after Xmx** (for example, Xmx4G means Minecraft is allowed to use 4GB RAM). Then click**Save** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4g-save.jpg)

Launch Minecraft and see if this helps fix the stuttering.

If this solution doesn’t work, take a look at the next fix.

## Fix 7: Uninstall OptiFine

 OptiFine is a Minecraft optimization mod, which allows the game to run faster and look better. However, it consumes some resources and may cause the stuttering issue. To see if that’s the case for you, you can try uninstalling OptiFine.

 If the stuttering issue remains after uninstalling OptiFine, check out the last fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 8: Reinstall Minecraft

 If none of the methods above seem to work for you, try reinstalling the game as a last resort. First, uninstall the current version of Minecraft from your computer, then reinstall the latest version of it. After that, relaunch the game to check if the stuttering issue is solved.
