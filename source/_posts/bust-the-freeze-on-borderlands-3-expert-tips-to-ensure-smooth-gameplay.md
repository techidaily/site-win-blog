### Fix 1: Meet_FM19_ â€˜s minimum specs

#### **What are the minimum specs?**

 The minimum specs are a listing of what hardware devices are required to operate your game properly. In most cases, game crash issues happen when players run the game on a computer that doesnâ€™t meet the minimum requirements. Here are_FM19_ â€˜s minimum specs:

| **OS:**        | Windows 7 64-bit or newer                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | Intel Pentium 4, Intel Core or AMD Athlon â€“ 2.2 GHz +                                    |
| **Graphics:**  | Intel GMA X4500, NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT or AMD/ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3650 â€“ 256MB VRAM |
| **Memory:**    | 2 GB RAM                                                                                 |

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-35-20.jpg)

 Now, relaunch_FM19_ to see if it works correctly. If your problem persists, move on to Fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the game crashing issue is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. To run_FM19_ smoothly, itâ€™s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver.

 You can update your device drivers manually, if youâ€™re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-37-03.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-37-07.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easyâ€™s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your game still crashes, then go ahead with the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY.**

**2)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**E** at the same time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-41-12.jpg)

### Fix 6: Set Game Launch Options

 Game Launch Options allow you to change game settings before launching it. Itâ€™s helpful if your issue is caused by improper in-game settings, and you canâ€™t run your game at all. Here are two options to try:

* **[Launch_FM19_ with the -renderer_direct3D9 option](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 7: Change the power option

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and R at the same time.
