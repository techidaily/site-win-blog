## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Use wire headsets](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Install Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Use wire headsets

 Some players have found out the game need to use a 3.5mm jack to bypass the headsets audio. Therefore, use a wired input instead of USB headphones. USB headphones are not working well with Evil Genius 2.

Hope it works for you, if not, try updating your audio driver.

### Fix 2: Update the audio driver

 Update your audio driver might fix. Driver is closely related to the audio issue, an outdated or corrupted audio driver would cause sound issue.

 You can not also update the driver manually via Device Manager or your driver’s manufacturer’s official website, but also update it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
