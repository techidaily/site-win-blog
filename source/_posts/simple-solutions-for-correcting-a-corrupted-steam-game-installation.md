 This error indicates a poor network connection from you or your friend’s network, a Steam glitch, or a problem with Steam’s server. So **it’s recommended that both you and your friends should be trying these fixes to isolate the culprit.**

### Fix 1: Clear Steam cache and cookies

 Steam saves files and data so that next time the same information can load up faster. However, overtime, the cached data may have gone wrong, corrupt or outdated, which may cause the friends list to stop loading.

To clear Steam cache:

1. Launch Steam and sign into your account.
2. Click**Steam** \>**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-2.png)
3. Select**Web Browser** , then click**DELETE WEB BROWSER CACHE** and**DELETE ALL BROWSER COOKIES** respectively. Once finished, click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1234.png)
4. Exit Steam.
5. Re-launch into Steam, then click if your friends list loads up fine. If yes, then great! If the**Friends Network Unreachable** error still pops up, please move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Join or exit Steam Beta programs

 Steam Beta is a program/mode players can opt into and try out game updates and client updates before they officially go live. Since it is a program for testing, it could be prone to bugs causing the friends list loading problem. But in other cases, it is the offical version where the glitch exists.

 So in this fix, you can try switching to the opposite mode to see if it helps receover your friends list.

Here’s how to join or exit Steam Beta programs:

1. Launch Steam and sign into your account.
2. Click**Steam** \>**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-2.png)
3. Select**Account** , then in Beta participation section, click**Change…** .

### Fix 3: Update your network adapter driver

 A network adapter driver is a piece of software that’s pivotal to the communication between your network adapter and your computer system. If the network adapter driver is wrong, outdated or corrupt, you may have unstable or poor internet, which potentially causes the Steam**Friends Network Unreachable** error. So you should update your network adapter driver to see if it solves the problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

6. Run Steam to check if the**Friends Network Unreachable** error has been fixed.

### Fix 5: Power cycle your modem & router

 The**Friends Network Unreachable** error may result from an overflooded router&modem in your local network. To clear out the old memory, you can perform a power cycle for your modem router. Power cycling, which involves the turn-off-turn-on tricks, allows your network devices to cool off and get a new IP.

The steps are pretty easy:

1. Unplug your modem (and your router, if it’s a separate device) from the power socket.

### Fix 6: Is it a server issue?
